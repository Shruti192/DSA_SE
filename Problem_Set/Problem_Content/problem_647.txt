b"\nIt's Morty's birthday today! As his birthday gift, Rick gives him weird gifts every year. This time, he got something really unique from the planet Gazorpazorp.\nThe gift is a box on which are written NN numbers, in the form of an array. On the back, there's a 'special number' KK printed. Finally on the top, there's a digital lock attached. \nRick tells Morty that the box can be opened, only when he enters the number of subsets of array whose multiplication of elements is divisible by KK, modulo 109+7109+7, as the passcode.\nAs Morty is busy with his birthday party, he hands over the box to you. Can you crack the passcode?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NN and KK. \nNext line will contain NN integers denoting the elements of the array.\n\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer, the count of subsets whose multiplication of elements is divisible by KK modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample Input:\n4 2\n\n1 2 3 4\nSample Output:\n12\n\nEXPLANATION:\n  Total subsets are 15. {1}, {3} and {1,3} are not divisible by 2.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85priyam2k\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CNTSET\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, medium, plin2020, priyam2k\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

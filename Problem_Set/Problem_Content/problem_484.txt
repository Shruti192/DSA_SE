Cell (2, 1) is attacked by the knight in cell (4, 2). Cell (2, 2) is attacked by the knight in cell (4, 1). Cell (3, 1) is attacked by the knight in cell (1, 2). And cell (3, 2) is attacked by the knight in cell (1, 1).\nSo every cell either contains a knight or is attacked by at least one knight, hence this is a valid configuration. There is no valid configuration with fewer knights, and so the answer is 4.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85deadwing97\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KNICOV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Chess, Case work, DP Bitmask, Bit Manipulation\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2566\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-05-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nRaghav studies in NSIT and is bored of the regular hostel mess food. For a change he went to a sweet shop at City Centre near the college to have some sweets. There he found only two boxes containing sweets; box 1 contains p sweets and box 2 contains q sweets.\nInitially, both boxes are closed. Raghav wants to eat exactly N sweets in total during the following process:\n\nChoose an index i (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 2) of one box and a number s (0 < s \xe2\x89\xa4 number of sweets in box i).\nOpen box i, take out s sweets, eat them and then close box i.\nWrite down number i exactly s times.\nIf less than N sweets have been eaten in total, repeat from the first step.\n\n\nThe index i of the box chosen at each step should always be different from the index of the previously selected box. In the beginning, either box can be chosen.\n\nAt the end, Raghav will have written down a sequence P1, P2, P3, ..., PN (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Pi \xe2\x89\xa4 2 for each valid i) describing the boxes containing the sweets he ate, in the given order. For example, if he has to eat N = 7 sweets, so he opens box 1 and takes out 3 sweets and then opens box 2 and takes out 4 sweets, then the sequence P1..N will be 1112222.\nIn addition, Raghav cannot eat more than Si sweets from box i in one step (s \xe2\x89\xa4 Si). Also, box i cannot be opened more than Bi times in total.\n\nCan you help Raghav determine the total number of possible sequences  P1..N satisfying the given constraints? Since this number can be large, compute it modulo 109 + 7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each testcase contains three space-separated integers p, q and N.\nThe second line contains two space-separated integers B1 and B2.\nThe third line contains two space-separated integers S1 and S2.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of possible sequences modulo 109 + 7.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 p, q \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 B1, B2, S1, S2 \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 p+q\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 15\nSubtask #2 (20 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 p, q \xe2\x89\xa4 20\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2 4\n2 2\n1 1\n10 10 10\n10 10\n10 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1024\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We have 2 sweets in box 1 and 2 sweets in box 2. All possible sequences P1..4 are: 1122, 2211, 1212, 2121, 1221 and 2112. Out of them, only 1212 and 2121 are valid, since S1 = S2 = 1.\nExample case 2: All possible 210 sequences are valid.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85abx_2109\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ABX02\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Memoization, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Recursion, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2374\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-10-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

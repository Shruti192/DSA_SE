b"\nIt's a story of long ego, Sondesh was on her first class of matrix. After coming back home, she was very curious about it. She was taking two matrix and was trying to add them. If she would be successful, as she was very fond of maximum and minimum of everything, tried to find out the elements which are minimum in their row but maximum in their coloumn.\nShe practiced for a while and now she is going for watching her favourite drama, so she asked her Meaw to do this tasks. Meaw is thinking of making a program to do that quick. Can you help him?\nInput:\nThere will be TT test cases. First line of the input is an integer- the value of TT.\nFirst line of each test case consists of two integer nn and mm which are the rows and coloumns of the first matrix. Next nn line with mm space separated integers in each line denotes the first matrix.\nNext line contains pp and qq which deontes row and coloumn of the second matrix and the last pp lines with qq space separated intregers in each line deontes the second matrix.\nOutput:\nIf it is not possible to add the matrices, print  Syntax error.\nElse print the elements Sondesh wants to find out.  Print the elements space separately.\nIf it is not possible to find such element which will be minimum in their row but maximum in their coloumn, print 404 not found.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m,p,q\xe2\x89\xa43001\xe2\x89\xa4n,m,p,q\xe2\x89\xa4300\nThe elements of the array will be in the range [0\xe2\x88\x92106][0\xe2\x88\x92106]\n\nSample Input:\n3\n3 3\n2 3 4\n1 2 6\n4 1 2\n3 3\n1 2 3\n5 6 7\n23 2 1\n3 3\n3 6 9\n3 10 22\n0 19 20\n3 3\n3 6 10\n0 1 1\n1 2 2\n3 3\n3 6 9\n3 10 22\n0 19 20\n3 2\n3 6 10\n0 1 1\n\nSample Output:\n404 not found\n6\nSyntax error\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the first sample, after adding the matrices, there is no element possible that can be row wise minimum and coloumn wise maximum.\nIn the second sample, after adding the two matrices, In the first row, minmin{66, 1212, 1919}= 66 and In the first coloumn, maxmax{66, 33, 11}=66. So, 66 is the element which is row wise minimum and coloumn wise maximum.\nIn the last sample, it is not possible to add the matrices.\n\nDataset can be huge. Use faster I/O method.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85aref111n\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MIMAX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aref111n, blas2020, easy-medium, implementation, math\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

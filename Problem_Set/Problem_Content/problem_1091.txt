b'\nArun has an integer NN. His friend likes the number 11, so Arun wants to reduce NN to 11.\nTo do so, he can perform the following move several times (possibly, zero):\n\nPick two integers XX and YY such that X+YX+Y is even and XYXY is a divisor of NN. Then, replace NN by NXYNXY\n\nNote that at each step, XYXY only needs to be a divisor of the current value of NN, and not necessarily a divisor of the integer Arun initially started with.\nFind the minimum number of moves Arun needs to reduce NN to 11. If it is not possible to reduce NN to 11 using the given operation, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 instead.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line of input containing one integer NN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a new line the answer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of moves needed to reduce NN to 11, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is not possible to do so.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n25\n24\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: Choose X=25X=25 and Y=1Y=1. X+Y=26X+Y=26 is even, and XY=25XY=25 is a divisor of N=25N=25 so this is a valid choice of XX and YY. Dividing NN by XYXY leaves us with 2525=12525=1 and we are done.\nTest case 22: It can be shown that no matter which moves are made, 2424 cannot be reduced to 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85arunsharma_\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RED1\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Prime Divisors\n                 \n                     \n                     Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Divisors\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2050\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nRead problem statements in Russian, Bengali, and Mandarin Chinese as well.\nYou are given an undirected graph with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN) and MM edges. Each edge connects two distinct nodes. However, there may be multiple edges connecting the same pairs of nodes, and they are considered to be distinct edges. A lowercase English letter is written in each node.\nYou are also given a string SS with length LL. A beautiful path is a sequence of L\xe2\x88\x921L\xe2\x88\x921 edges such that there is a sequence of LL nodes with the following properties:\n\nfor each valid ii, the ii-th edge connects the ii-th and (i+1)(i+1)-th of these nodes\nfor each valid ii, the ii-th character of SS is written in the ii-th of these nodes\n\nThere are no other restrictions \xe2\x80\x94 a path may visit nodes or edges any number of times in any order.\nDetermine the number of beautiful paths in the graph. Since the answer can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and LL.\nThe second line contains a single string SS with length LL.\nThe third line contains a single string with length NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of the string is the letter written in the ii-th node.\nTwo lines follow. The first line contains MM integers u1,\xe2\x80\xa6,umu1,\xe2\x80\xa6,um. The second lines contains MM integers, v1,\xe2\x80\xa6,vmv1,\xe2\x80\xa6,vm. This denotes that there is an edge connecting nodes uiui and to vivi. These edges are distinct, even though they may connect the same pair of nodes.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of beautiful paths modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41032\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4103\n2\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4202\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa420\nSS contains only lowercase English letters\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nu\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 4 3\naac\naaca\n1 2 2 1\n2 3 4 2\n2 1 2\naa\naa\n1\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The three beautiful paths (sequences of edges) are:\n\n(1,2)(1,2), passing through nodes (1,2,3)(1,2,3) in this order\n(4,2)(4,2), also passing through nodes (1,2,3)(1,2,3)\n(3,2)(3,2), passing through nodes (4,2,3)(4,2,3)\n\nExample case 2: There is only one beautiful path, which contains only edge 11.

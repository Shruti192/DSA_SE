b'\nPhoenix is very tired of his examinations and he only has his mathematics paper remaining. Now, Phoenix hates mathematics and this year he had to take mathematics as an elective because all his friends were in it. This year\xe2\x80\x99s course contains linear equations and factorization and he is good in only factorization. So, after practicing mathematics for the whole night, he entered the exam hall.\nHe opened the paper and found just one question ending in \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6sum of the factors of XX.\xe2\x80\x9d and he became glad. But all his hopes came crashing down as he read the whole question. It went like this - \n\xe2\x80\x9cGiven a system of linear equations, solve them and find the sum of its solutions. Consider the absolute value of the sum of its solutions as XX, and choose the option that correctly shows the sum of the factors of XX.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNow, it\xe2\x80\x99s all up to you to help Phoenix end his test in a pleasant manner so that he can be happy that he cleared his examinations and can enjoy his summer vacations. Can you help him?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, having an integer NN followed by NN lines having the coefficients of the equation and the RHS. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the sum of all the factors of XX.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x89\xa410\n2\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420\xe2\x89\xa420\n|coefficient|\xe2\x89\xa430|coefficient|\xe2\x89\xa430\n\nSample Input:\n    1\n    2\n    2 3 5\n    3 3 6\n\nSample Output:\n    3\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis value of NN is 22 so we can infer that that there are two linear equations of two variables.\nThe equations are\n2a+3b=52a+3b=5\n3a+3b=63a+3b=6\nNow, finding the solutions of the variables, it can be said that aa = 11 and bb = 11, hence their sum is 22.\nThe sum of all the factors of 22 i.e, 11 and 22 is 33, hence the output.\nNote\nThere are n linear equations denoting the straight lines in an n-dimensional space and hence it should not be assumed that it is only limited to 3D or 2D space.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85nisu29\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDVNT01H\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cove2020, gaussian-elimination, math, matrices, nisu29\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-07-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, PYPY, kotlin\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

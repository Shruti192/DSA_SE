b'\nBILLIARDS is a really interesting game. It is played on a green baize with 3 balls-red, white and yellow.\nSheldon and Leonard are playing a game of billiards. Sheldon is playing the game for the first time and is not familiar with the rules. So he asks Leonard to explain the rules to him. Leonard explains the rules to Sheldon in the following way:  \n\xe2\x80\x9cA Cannon shot gives 22 points and an In-Off Shot gives 33 points.\xe2\x80\x9d \nSheldon is curious, and wants to figure out that given a score X, in how many ways can he get that score by hitting a combination of Cannon and In-Off shots? \nLeonard is baffled when he is asked this question.  \nYour task is to help Leonard in writing a program to compute the total number of ways one can score a total of XX points by hitting any combination of Cannon and In-Off shots. The order in which the shots are hit have importance.  \nFor example, 55 can be scored in two ways, by hitting an In-Off Shot followed by a Cannon shot or a Cannon Shot followed by an In-Off shot. A score of 77 can be achieved in three ways \xe2\x80\x93 Cannon,In-Off,Cannon Cannon,Cannon,In-Off and In-Off,Cannon,Cannon.\nInput\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer TT which denotes the number of test cases. 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42000 \nThe next TT lines will each have a positive integer XX, denoting the score which has to be achieved.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, Output a single line containing the total number of ways one can score a score of X by hitting only Cannon and In-Off shots. Since the number can be very large, Output the answer MOD 10000000091000000009 (109+9)(109+9)\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4103 (30 Points)\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4106 (70 Points)\n\nExample\nSample Input:\n3  \n5  \n7  \n2 \n\nSample Output:\n2  \n3  \n1  \n\nExplanation\nExplanations of the first two cases are mentioned above. In the third case, a score of 22 can be achieved by hitting a cannon.\nThe Input and Output Format must be STRICTLY FOLLOWED\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85animesh_f\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDQU5\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 animesh_f, cdqu2014, dynamic-programming, memoization, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-11-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

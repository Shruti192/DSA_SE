b"\n\nSamosa Bhai got tired of the difficult tasks given by CodeChef along with meagre salary being paid to him. So he moves to Aloo uncle's village and opens a courier company there. In the village, everyone knows Aloo uncle and Kachori Aunty, so everyone sends their gifts using Samosa Bhai's courier company only.\nThere are N houses in a row in the village. On New Year's Eve, each house sends a gift to all the other houses.\nThe distance between two houses situated at positions x and y in the row is |x - y|. Samosa Bhai's courier company charges dk rupees for each delivery, where d is the distance between the 2 houses. \n\nEveryone chose Samosa Bhai's company because of Aloo uncle and Kachori aunty. So he decides to give them the amount of money earned by him modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). You need to compute this amount.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains 2 integers \xe2\x80\x94 N and k \xe2\x80\x94 denoting the number of houses and the exponent k, resepctively. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, \xe2\x80\xa6 , AN denoting the positions of the houses. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line with the amount given to Aloo uncle and Kachori aunty by Samosa Bhai.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000006\nThe sum of N over all test cases will be at most 100000\n2 houses can be at the same position\n\nExample\nInput:\n5\n2 2\n7 2\n2 3\n7 2\n3 2\n1 3 2\n10 2\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n10 10\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nOutput:\n50\n250\n12\n1650\n558199159\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. House 1 sends a gift to House 2 with cost (|2 - 7|)2 and house 2 sends a gift to house 1 with cost (|7-2|)2, for a total cost of 50\nExample case 3. The cost for gift from house with index 1 to house with index 2 is 22 = 4, from houses 1 to 3 is 1, from houses 2 to 3 is 1. Taking into account the gifts sent the other way (from 2 to 1, 3 to 1 and 3 to 2), the total cost is 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85balajiganapath\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KOL1506\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Pre processing, Modular Arithmetic, Binomial Theorem, Top-down, Bottom-up\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Algebra, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-12-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

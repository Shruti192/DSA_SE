b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\nBeing a CS student, Ron really don\'t understand why he has to take a compulsory course called "Art in Digital Age". \nThe objective of this course from what his school said is to help the CS students release the stress by doing something new other from coding/programming. The problem is Ron really love coding and he doesn\'t care about other stuff. This course even gives him \nmore stress. However, like it or not Ron still need to try his best not to let this course ruins his great GPA. \nCan you help him with his first assignment which is described below.\n\n\nIn this assignment, Ron is given an N\xc3\x97N pixels image called sample image. Ron is required to create a copy of the \nsample image using an simple graphic painting program called SMPaint. Only two types of operation can be used in SMPaint:\n\nInit: Make the new image with the specific size, all the pixels of the new image are white.\nPaint: User gives 5 integers C, U, D, L, R and SMPaint will change colour to C at all the pixels (x, y) such that (U \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 D and L \xe2\x89\xa4 y \xe2\x89\xa4 R).\nThe pixel (x, y) is the pixel at the xth row (from the top, 1-indexed) and the yth column (from the left side, 1-indexed).\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the Paint operation actually is painting a specific rectangle in the image by one specific colour.\nThe image in the figure 1 can be drawn using 3 calls of the second function if we paint the red rectangle first and then paint two \ngreen rectangles. Notice that if a pixel is changed colour several time, it final colour is corresponding to the last time it is painted. \nThis help us save some calls of the second function. For the image in figure 1 we can paint a large green rectangle first and then paint the red rectangle.\nYour mission is help Ron finish the assignment with using as least as possible number of calls of the second function.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains integer N. Each of the next N lines contains N integers. The yth number in the xth line \nrepresent the colour of the pixel (x, y) in the sample image.\n\nOutput\nThe first line of the output must contain integer M that is the number of calls of the second function you need. \nThe next M lines represent the calls to the second function in chronological order. \nEach line must contain 5 integers which are the values (they must be in this order) C, U, D, L, R for the corresponding call. The following conditions must be held: \n\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 C \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 U \xe2\x89\xa4 D \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nThe colours are represented by integers from 0 to 100 where 0 means white colour.\n\nExample\nInput:\n5\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 2 1 0\n0 1 2 1 0\n0 1 2 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n2\n1 2 4 2 4\n2 2 4 3 3\n\n\xc2\xa0\n Scoring & the test data generation \n\nYour solution will not get point if it performs more than N2 Paint operations or the final image is different \nwith the sample one. Your solution will be marked as Wrong Answer for that two cases.\n\nIf the number of Paint operations does not exceed N2 and the final image is the same as the sample one\nyou will get the score which is equal to the number of Paint operations. Smaller score means your solution is better.  \n\nThe test data is generated randomly by simulating the process of making an image in SMPaint using no more than 500 Paint operations. But please note that, the value of N is picked manually.  \n\nWe have 25 official test files. You must correctly solve all test files to receive OK. \nDuring the contest, your overall score is the sum of the scores on the first 7 test files. \nAfter the contest, all solutions will be rescored by the sum of the scores on the rest 18 test files.\nNote, that public part of the tests can not contain some border cases. For example, we should say that \nin all public tests 10 \xe2\x89\xa4 N holds.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntuan_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85gerald\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SMPAINT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 challenge, dec13, dynamic-programming, greedy, heuristic, tuan_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3550\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-09-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

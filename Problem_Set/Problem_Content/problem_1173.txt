b'\nDogesh and his entire kingdom live in a castle. Many times, they have received war threats from their neighborhood kingdom were monkeys live. To save his life and his kingdom he asks his friend, Cheems for help. Cheems suggests to construct some tunnels in the Warfield which opens up on the opposite side of the castle.\nAssume that castle of Dogesh lies on the line represented as y=mx+cy=mx+c and a set of NN points on Warfield in the form of (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi) for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4Xi\xe2\x89\xa4N,1\xe2\x89\xa4Yi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Xi\xe2\x89\xa4N,1\xe2\x89\xa4Yi\xe2\x89\xa4N. You have to find out the number of pair of points which upon joining will make the tunnel that will help Dogesh to reach the opposite side of castle.\nNote: Do not consider those points which lie on the castle (the given line).\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFor each test case, first line will contain three space separated integers N,m,cN,m,c.\nNext N lines will contain two space separated integer Xi,YiXi,Yi.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, Print the number of pair of points which upon joining will make a tunnel that will cross the castle.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|m|,|c|,|Xi|,|Yi|\xe2\x89\xa4109|m|,|c|,|Xi|,|Yi|\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of N over all testcases does not exceed 105105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 1 1\n0 -10\n9 10\n-10 10\n10 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nThe given castle line is y=x+1(m=1,c=1). Since (9,10) lies on the castle.\nOut of the remaining three points, (0, 10) and (10,3) lies on one side of castle while (-10,10) lies on opposite side of castle. \n So a total of 2 pairs can be formed (-10,10),(0,-10) and (-10,10),(10,3).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shreenath_125\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RSLN2202\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 math, rsln2022, shreenath_125\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

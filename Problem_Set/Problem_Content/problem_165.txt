b"\n\nToday is Chota Mouse's birthday. He wants to celebrate it in a grand style. His brother Mota Chuha immediately contacted a nearby bakery for an online delivery of a cake. The cake is of rectangular shape with height H and width W. Chota Mouse has invited F of his friends to the party. So, he wants to make F vertical cuts at distinct positions on the cake, so that the cake will be divided into F + 1 non-zero area parts (F for his friends and one for himself).\n\n\nLet us assume the cake is placed along the coordinate axis with its left end at x coordinate 0 and right end at W. Please see the image in the examples for details.\nHe will make cuts at positions Pi such that Pi is strictly greater than zero and strictly less than W.\nAlso note that, all the positions for cutting are distinct.\n\n\nChota Mouse is a nice guy. So, he will be keeping the piece with the least area for himself and leave the other pieces for his friends to enjoy.\nChota Mouse is weak in mathematics, so can you please help him figure out the area of the piece he is going to have?\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nFirst line of each test case contains three space separated integers F, H, W.\nSecond line of each test case contains F space separated integers, i-th of them denotes Pi.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 F \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 H \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\nF + 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 W \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Pi \xe2\x89\xa4 W - 1\n\nSample\nInput\n3\n1 1 2\n1\n1 4 5\n3\n2 3 9\n6 2\nOutput\n1\n8\n6\nExplanation\nIn the first example,\nboth the pieces have same area (i.e. = 1). \n\n\nIn the second example,\nthere are two pieces. First piece has an area of 12, second has an area of 8. So, the answer will be 8. \n\n\nIn the third example,\nthere are three pieces. First piece has an area of 6, second 12, and third 9. So, the answer will be 6.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 acm15amr, ad-hoc, admin2, greedy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-12-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

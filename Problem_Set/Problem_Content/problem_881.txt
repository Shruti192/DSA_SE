b"\nProblem Statement\n\nYou are a student of NIT Jalandhar and have a team of coders with you. There are students(coders) of k levels in your team. Each level has a particular coding skill value. Now you are given G number of experts to increase the level of your students. You can choose one student and use an expert to train student and increase its level by 1. An expert can only be used once and for one student only. You can train the same student continuosly by using experts. But students of level N can't be trained because they hae maximum skills.Students upto (N-1) levels can be expertised. A student can maximally be trained upto Nth level. You are given number of students in each level and coding skill value of each level. Coding skill of your team is sum of skill value of all students. Find out the maximum possible coding skill of your team after using G experts.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contain number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case contains number of levels(N).\nNext line contains N space separated values denoting number of students in each level.\nNext line contains N space separated values denoting skill value of each level.\nAnd last line of each test case contains value of G, number of test case.\n\nOutput\nA single integer denoting total coding skill of your team for each test case.\nConstraints\n1 <= N <= 50\n0 <= Pi <= 10^6\n0 <= Si <= 10^6\nExemple\nInput\n1\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5\noutput\n\n60\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85ratish1992\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PREE04\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dsec2013, dynamic-programming, medium, ratish1992\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-10-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.294737 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nChef has an array AA of NN integers. He asks you QQ queries. For each query, you are given the following:\n\nAn integer XX (0\xe2\x89\xa4X<220)(0\xe2\x89\xa4X<220).\nAn array BB of size MM such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4Bj\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Bj\xe2\x89\xa4N. \n\nYou need to erase minimum number of elements from AA such that the bitwise-OR of the remaining elements is at most XX and no element having index BjBj is erased.\nFor each query, find the maximum number of remaining elements such that the bitwise OR of the remaining elements is at most XX and no element with index BjBj is erased. If it is impossible to get an OR of at most XX, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\nNote: The bitwise OR of an empty array is considered 00.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input consists of integers NN and QQ, the number of elements in the array and the number of queries. \nThe next line contains NN space separated integers, the elements of the array AA. The descriptions of the QQ queries follow.\nThe first line of each query consists of integers XX and MM, the integer XX and the number of indices that cannot be erased.\nThe last line of each query consists of MM space separated integers BjBj denoting that the elements ABjABj cannot be erased. Note that, this line is omitted if M=0M=0.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint QQ lines, the answers to each of the queries.\nFor each query, print -1 if it is impossible to get an OR of at most XX. Otherwise, print the maximum number of remaining elements.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,X<2200\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,X<220\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bj<Bj+1\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Bj<Bj+1\xe2\x89\xa4N, \xe2\x88\x80j\xe2\x88\x80j such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4j<M1\xe2\x89\xa4j<M\nSum of MM over all queries does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (40 points): Q=1,M=0Q=1,M=0.\nSubtask 2 (60 points): No additional constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 1\n4 3 5\n6 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nThe given array A=[4,3,5]A=[4,3,5]. In binary representation, A=[1002,0112,1012]A=[1002,0112,1012].  We are given that the size of array \nBB is 00. Thus, we can delete any element of the array AA.  \n\nErase 00 elements: The remaining array A=[1002,0112,1012]A=[1002,0112,1012]. Bitwise OR of the remaining elements is 10021002 || 01120112 || 1012=1112=71012=1112=7. Since X<7X<7, we have to erase some elements of the array.\nErase 11 element: If we erase the element at index 22, the remaining array A=[1002,1012]A=[1002,1012]. Bitwise OR of the remaining elements is:\n10021002 || 1012=1012=51012=1012=5. Since X\xe2\x89\xa55X\xe2\x89\xa55, all the required conditions are satisfied.\n\nThus, the maximum number of remaining elements is 22.\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 2\n14 8 11 6 3\n14 1\n4\n3 2\n2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nThe given array A=[14,8,11,6,3]A=[14,8,11,6,3]. In binary representation, A=[11102,10002,10112,01102,00112]A=[11102,10002,10112,01102,00112].\n\nQuery 11: We are given that the element at index 44 cannot be erased.\nA possible way to satisfy the given conditions is to erase the elements at indices 33 and 55. Thus, the remaining array would be A=[11102,10002,01102]A=[11102,10002,01102]. The bitwise OR of remaining elements would be 1414 which is less than equal to XX.\nIt can be proven that the maximum number of remaining elements cannot exceed 33.\nQuery 22: We are given that the elements at indices 22 and 44 cannot be erased. In the worst case that we erase all other elements, we are left with [10002,01102][10002,01102]. The bitwise OR of these elements is 11102=14>311102=14>3. Thus, it is impossible to erase some elements leaving an OR of at most 33.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85ashishgup\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SQUEEZE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ashishgup, dynamic-programming, medium, start30\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3011\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nTo address the situation of Water Scarcity in Chefland, Chef has started an awareness campaign to motivate people to use greywater for toilets, washing cars, gardening, and many other chores which don\'t require the use of freshwater. These activities presently consume yy liters of water every week per household and Chef thinks through this campaign he can help cut down the total usage to \xe2\x8c\x8ay2\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8ay2\xe2\x8c\x8b.\nAssuming xx liters of water every week per household is consumed at chores where using freshwater is mandatory and a total of CC liters of water is available for the entire Chefland having HH households for a week, find whether all the households can now have sufficient water to meet their requirements.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, four integers H,x,y,CH,x,y,C. \n\nOutput:\nPrint a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to meet the requirement of all the households in Chefland or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4300\n1\xe2\x89\xa4H,x,y\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4H,x,y\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 1 1 3\n1 1 1 2\n2 1 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nTestCase 1: \nTotal consumption of a single household after using greywater = 1+1+ \xe2\x8c\x8a12\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8a12\xe2\x8c\x8b = 1+01+0 = 11 liter.\nTotal consumption of three households after using greywater = 3\xe2\x88\x971=33\xe2\x88\x971=3 liters which is equal to the available quantity of water.\nTestCase 2: \nTotal consumption of a single household after using greywater = 1+1+ \xe2\x8c\x8a12\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8a12\xe2\x8c\x8b = 1+01+0 = 11 liter which is less than the available quantity of water.\nTestCase 3: \nTotal consumption of a single household after using greywater = 1+1+ \xe2\x8c\x8a12\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8a12\xe2\x8c\x8b = 1+01+0 = 11 liter.\nTotal consumption of two households after using greywater = 2\xe2\x88\x971=22\xe2\x88\x971=2 liters which is more than the available quantity of water.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SAVWATER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Conditional Statements, Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n918\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

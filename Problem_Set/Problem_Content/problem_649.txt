b"\nGoku and vegeta are fighting rigorously from a long time, but they can't arrive to a conclusion that who is better and stronger than the other. So they decided to do it by other means. \nBoth of them started playing chess on an N\xc3\x97MN\xc3\x97M chess-board and vegeta has already placed RR Black rooks on the chess-board and then he asks goku to place one White rook on the chess-board such that it is safe . As we all know that goku is a big dumb head and can't do it by himself , we need to help him. \nFind the probability of goku making a correct move . The probability is in form of P/QP/Q , where you need to find and print PP and QQ which are both co-prime integers .\nNOTENOTE : HowHow DoesDoes AA RookRook Attack??Attack??\nWhen a rook is placed on co-ordinates (XX,YY) , It attacks Whole Row No XX and Column No YY\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nFirst line of each testcase contains two space separated integers N,MN,M.\nSecond line contains one integer RR, which denotes number of rooks already placed.\nNext RR lines contains two space separated integers XX , YY depicting co-ordinates of the respective rook .  \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output should contain two space separated integers PP and QQ .\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4(N\xc3\x97M)\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4(N\xc3\x97M)\xe2\x88\x921\n\nSubtasks\n\n20 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n30 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4MAX(N,M)1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4MAX(N,M)\n50 points : (original(original constraints)constraints)\n\nSample Input:\n    3\n    8 8\n    1\n    5 3\n    6 6\n    2\n    5 3\n    3 5\n    2 2\n    2\n    1 1\n    2 2\n\nSample Output:\n    49 64\n    4 9\n    0\n\nEXPLANATION:\nTest\xe2\x88\x92Case:1Test\xe2\x88\x92Case:1\n\nFrom this chessboard we can see that goku's probability to make right move is 49/6449/64 so the ans is 4949 6464\nTest\xe2\x88\x92Case:2Test\xe2\x88\x92Case:2\n\nFrom this chessboard we can see that goku's probability to make right move is 16/36=4/916/36=4/9 so the ans is 44 99\nTest\xe2\x88\x92Case:3Test\xe2\x88\x92Case:3\n\nFrom this chessboard we can see there's no place to move for goku so the probability is 00\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85mann2108\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SPBRD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 chess, dynamic-programming, easy, mann2108\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

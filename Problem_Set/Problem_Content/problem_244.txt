b"\nMr. White and Jessy Pinkman has earned some money on their first drug deal. There are NN type of dollars such as AA1,AA2,AA3\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6AAn, each of a seperate value. They have an argument about the sharing of the money.So they decided to toss a coin to decide who will select first. \nIf head(HH) appears then Mr. White will get the chance to select first and then Pinkman otherwise incase of Tails(TT) it's turn for Jessy Pinkman to select first and then Mr.White. \nEach of the individual will select a dollar value at their turn optimally and one can't select the dollar note which has already been occupied. This will continue until every dollar is shared between them and at each selection they will toss the coin to decide. \nYou have to find the one who gets more share of the money and its value.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains three lines of input-- \nThe number of dollars(NN) available.\nThe value of NN no. of dollar notes in a single \n                                                                                  line seperated by a space such as A1A1,A2A2,A3A3\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6AnAn.\n[N+1]/2[N+1]/2 space separated values denoting \n                                                                                   the toss results. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output the name of the person (Mr. White or Pinkman) with more share of the money and the value of money he gets, seperated by a space.\nIf both gets same amount of money then print '-1'(without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4104 , 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\nSample Input:\n3\n4\n100 90 85 45\nH T\n5\n85 73 49 33 23 \nT H H\n3\n112 66 46\nT H\n\nSample Output:\nPinkman 175\nMr. White 145\n-1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85riktam_kundu24\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BRKPR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 brkc2020, easy, greedy, riktam_kundu24, sorting, strings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nChef wants to teach a lesson of sharing to the students.\nThere are NN students (numbered from 11 to NN from left to right) who are asked to stand in a row. Initially Chef gave AAii candies to the iithth child. In one operation any child can give any number of candies to the child standing to his immediate left (i.e. iithth child can give any amount of candies to the (i\xe2\x88\x921)(i\xe2\x88\x921)thth child. In particular 1st child cannot give his candies to anyone).  \nHe asked them to minimize the maximum value of candies a student can possess after performing any number of operations (possibly zero). \nHelp the students finding such maximum value.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nFirst line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the number of students.\nSecond line contains NN space-separated integers AA11,AA22,.......... AANN denoting the initial amount of candies chef gave to them.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 maximum value after sharing.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n00 \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 AAii \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 109109\nSum of NN over all Test Cases does not exceed 105105\n\nSample Input\n2 \n5 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n\nSample Output\n3 \n5  \n\nExplanation\n\nFor First Test Case:\nThe 55thth student will give 22 candies to 44thth student and 44thth will give 33 candies to 33rdrd and 33rdrd will give 33 candies to 22ndnd and 22ndnd will give 22 candies to 11stst. So finally the number of candies that they will have are \n[3,3,3,3,3][3,3,3,3,3] and the value of maximum candies is 33.\nFor Second Test Case:\nSharing to the left student will not change the maximum value as 11stst cannot share to anyone. So the maximum value will remain 55.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85aman1108\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COCR106\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aman1108, cros2020, greedy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

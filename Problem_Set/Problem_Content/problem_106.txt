b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a string SS with length NN and you should change it to a palindrome using a sequence of zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two adjacent elements of SS (two characters) and swap them; however, neither of these elements may be used in any other operation.\nFind the minimum number of operations you have to perform in order to change the string SS into a palindrome, or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains a single string SS with length NN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible to make the string SS a palindrome, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum required number of operations.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSS contains only lowercase English letters\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa4103N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSS contains only characters \'a\' and \'b\'\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 104104\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\nabab\n5\nacbba\n5\naaaab\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n1\nYES\n1\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SWAPPALI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2147\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-02-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. Consider every pair that consists of:\n1)1) One of the longest non-decreasing subsequences of AA.\n2)2) One of the longest non-increasing subsequences of AA. \nFind the maximum possible length of the longest common subsequence of the two sequences in such a pair.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum possible length of the longest common subsequence of any longest non-decreasing subsequence of AA and any longest non-increasing subsequence of AA.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): \n\nT\xe2\x89\xa490T\xe2\x89\xa490\nN\xe2\x89\xa41000N\xe2\x89\xa41000\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 50005000\nthe numbers in the sequence AA are pairwise distinct\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points): \n\nT\xe2\x89\xa442T\xe2\x89\xa442\nN\xe2\x89\xa41000N\xe2\x89\xa41000\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 50005000\n\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n8\n6 5 1 2 7 8 4 3\n6\n1 6 5 2 3 4\n7\n2 5 3 3 1 3 7\n6\n6 1 4 2 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n3\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: No pair of subsequences, containing one of the longest non-decreasing subsequences and one of longest non-increasing subsequences have a number in common. Hence, the answer is 00.\nExample case 2: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is 11 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence {1,2,3,4}{1,2,3,4} and the longest non-increasing subsequence {6,5,2}{6,5,2}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is {2}{2}.\nExample case 3: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is 33 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence {2,3,3,3,7}{2,3,3,3,7} and the longest non-increasing subsequence {5,3,3,3}{5,3,3,3}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is {3,3,3}{3,3,3}.\nExample case 4: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is 22 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence {1,4,4,5}{1,4,4,5} and the longest non-increasing subsequence {6,4,4}{6,4,4}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is {4,4}{4,4}.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85losmi247\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SUBLCS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 1D Arrays, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP on sequences\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2743\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

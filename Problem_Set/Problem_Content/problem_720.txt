He also has NN coins, numbered 11 through NN; for each valid ii, the ii-th coin has value ViVi.\nChef wants to give all coins to his two children in the following way: He traverses all coins in a particular order; for each coin, he checks which child currently has less money in total and gives this coin to that child (if both have the same amount of money, Chefu is given the coin).\nChefu is studying computer science, so he knows that this method is not necessarily the most fair way of partitioning the coins, but Chef does not understand why, since he is only a cook.\nNow, Chefu wants to take advantage of that and choose the order in which Chef should give out the coins in such a way that the amount of money he gets is maximised. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers V1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VNV1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 a permutation of numbers 11 through NN denoting the indices of the coins in the order in which Chef should traverse them. If there is more than one optimal solution, you may print any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa4500 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN for all test cases does not exceed 500500\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): the sum of NN for all test cases does not exceed 8080\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n2\n4\n5 3 20 9\n4\n2 2 2 2\n\nExample Output\n2 4 1 3\n1 2 3 4\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COINPART\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Unbounded Knapsack, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Knapsack\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2804\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-09-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

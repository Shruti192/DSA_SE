Suddenly, Akbar noticed a bunch of sticks on the ground and decided to test Birbal's wits.\nThere are NN stick holders with negligible size (numbered 11 through NN) in a row on the ground. Akbar places all the sticks in them vertically; for each valid ii, the initial height of the stick in the ii-th holder is AiAi. Birbal has a stick cutter and his task is to completely cut all these sticks, i.e. reduce the heights of all sticks to 00. He may perform zero or more operations; in each operation, he should do the following:\n\nChoose an integer HH and fix the cutter at the height HH above the ground.\nThe cutter moves from the 11-st to the NN-th stick holder. Whenever it encounters a stick whose current height is greater than HH, it cuts this stick down to height HH (i.e. for a stick with height h>Hh>H, it removes its upper part with length h\xe2\x88\x92Hh\xe2\x88\x92H).\nAll the upper parts of sticks that are cut in one operation must have equal lengths. Otherwise, the operation may not be performed.\n\nFor example, if the heights of sticks are initially [5,3,5][5,3,5], then some valid values for HH in the first operation are 33 and 44 \xe2\x80\x95 the cutter cuts the upper parts of two sticks and their lengths are [2,2][2,2] and [1,1][1,1] respectively. H=2H=2 is an invalid choice because it would cut the upper parts of all three sticks with lengths [3,1,3][3,1,3], which are not all equal.\nAkbar wants Birbal to completely cut all sticks in the minimum possible number of operations. If you want to be friends with Birbal, help him solve the problem.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of operations needed to completely cut all the sticks.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa450N\xe2\x89\xa450\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n1 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Birbal may perform the following three operations:\n\nFix the cutter at H=2H=2. The heights of the sticks after this operation are [1,2,2][1,2,2].\nFix the cutter at H=1H=1. The heights of the sticks after this operation are [1,1,1][1,1,1].\nFix the cutter at H=0H=0. After this operation, all sticks are completely cut.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85sahi1422\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREE2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arrays, Observation, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1199\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

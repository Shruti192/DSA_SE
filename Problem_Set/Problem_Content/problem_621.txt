b'\nChef and two of his friends are going on a biking trip this new year. They decided to rent three bikes from a shop.\nThe shop has NN bikes, the ii-th of which has a mileage of MiMi.\nChef and friends decided that they would rent three distinct bikes i,j,ki,j,k satisfying the following property:\n(Mi\xe2\x8a\x95Mj)&Mk=Mi\xe2\x8a\x95(Mj&Mk)(Mi\xe2\x8a\x95Mj)&Mk=Mi\xe2\x8a\x95(Mj&Mk)\nwhere \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 denotes bitwise XOR and && denotes bitwise AND.\nPlease help them find out the number of different ways in which they can select the bikes.\nNote that two ways are considered to be different if the ordered triples of indices (i,j,k)(i,j,k) are distinct, so for example (1,2,3)(1,2,3), (1,2,4)(1,2,4) and (1,3,2)(1,3,2) are all distinct even if the bikes are such that M1=M2=M3=M4=1M1=M2=M3=M4=1.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of two lines:\nThe first line contains an integer NN, denoting the number of bikes available.\nThe next line contains NN space-separated integers M1,M2,\xe2\x80\xa6,MNM1,M2,\xe2\x80\xa6,MN denoting the mileage of each bike.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the number of ways to choose a triple of bikes.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41053\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Mi\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4Mi\xe2\x89\xa4106\nSum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n4 5 6\n3\n1 2 4\n6\n2 6 8 9 10 13\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n0\n24\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 11: The two ways to select three bikes are (1,2,3)(1,2,3) and (1,3,2)(1,3,2) (note that the triples are of indices, not values).\nTest Case 22: There are no ways to select three bikes satisfying the given condition.\nTest Case 33: Some ways to select three bikes are:\n\n(1,2,5)(1,2,5)\n(1,5,2)(1,5,2)\n(3,1,6)(3,1,6)\n(4,3,6)(4,3,6)\n(3,2,4)(3,2,4)\n(1,6,5)(1,6,5)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nnandeesh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/THREEBIKES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, SOS DP, Bitwise Operation, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3078\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

Find the expected value of P(A)P(A).\nFor each valid nn, it can be proved that the expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/QP/Q, where PP and QQ are positive integers and QQ is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q\xe2\x88\x921 is the multiplicative inverse of QQ modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers NN, KK, LL and RR.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353 for n=in=i.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4106\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of KK over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2 2 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 748683266\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: For n=1n=1, we have P([1])=P([2])=1P([1])=P([2])=1 and P(A)=0P(A)=0 for any other sequence. Hence, the expected value is 2/2=12/2=1.\nFor n=2n=2, there are four valid sequences [1,1][1,1], [1,2][1,2], [2,1][2,1] and [2,2][2,2]. Each of them can be split into one-element subsequences. In addition, [1,1][1,1] can be left unchanged (split into only one subsequence), so P([1,1])=2P([1,1])=2. The expected value is (2+1+1+1)/4=5/4=748,683,266(2+1+1+1)/4=5/4=748,683,266.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85krikti\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PART\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 FFT, NTT, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Transformations, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2988\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

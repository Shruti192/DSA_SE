By doing this, Alok-nath can create equality amongst his followers and he\'ll be called a true \xe2\x80\x9csanskari\xe2\x80\x9d.\nAlok-nath has N sanskars, and K followers. Each sanskar is given a numerical value which shows its intensity.\nYour task is to determine whether it is possible to allocate all the sanskars to followers in such a way that the sum of intensities of the sanskars allocated to each follower is equal. Note : A sanskar can be allocated to only one of the followers.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each case contains two integers N and K, with N denoting the number of sanskars and K denoting the number of followers. In the next line are N space separated integers denoting the intensities of each sanskar.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output "yes" if it is possible to divide his sanskars equally amongst his followers; otherwise output "no" (without quotes).\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 21\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 8\nSubtask #1 (20 points) : 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 intensity of sanskar \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\nSubtask #2 (80 points) : 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 intensity of sanskar \xe2\x89\xa4 10^10\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 3\n1 2 4 5 6\n5 3\n1 2 4 5 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nyes\nno\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first case, sanskars can be allocated as follows, each follower receiving a total intensity of 6: {1,5}, {2,4}, {6}.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\njay_adm\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85shiplu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SANSKAR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2D Arrays, DP Bitmask, Bitmasking\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2042\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-02-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

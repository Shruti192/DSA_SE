b'\nThe auditorium of Stanford University is made up of L*R matrix (assume each coordinate has a chair). On the occasion of an event Chef was called as a chief guest. The auditorium was filled with males (M) and females (F), occupying one chair each. Our Chef is very curious guy, so he asks the gatekeeper some queries. The queries were as follows: Is there any K*K sub-matrix in the auditorium which contains all Males or Females.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers L, R  and Q describing the dimension of the auditorium and the number of questions Chef will ask.\nEach of next L lines contains R characters (M or F).\nNext Q lines contains K and a character (M or F).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query output "yes" (without quotes) if there exist any K*K sub-matrix in the auditorium which contains all Males (if he asks about Male) or Females (if he asks about Female), otherwise output "no" (without quotes).\n\nConstraints and Subtasks\n\n1 <= L, R, K <= 1000\n1 <= Q <= 1e6\n\nSubtask 1: 30 points\n\n1 <= L, R, Q <= 200\n\nSubtask 2: 70 points\n\nOriginal Contraints\n\nExample\nInput:\n4 3 3\nMMF\nMMM\nFFM\nFFM\n2 F\n3 M\n1 M\n\nOutput:\nyes\nno\nyes\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85adi28galaxyak\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDVA1605\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 adi28galaxyak, cdva16, dynamic-programming, easy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-01-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

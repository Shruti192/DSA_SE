On each day, each citizen has to pay a tax; let's denote the tax paid by the ii-th citizen by AiAi.\nOne day, Roger was extremely bored, so he decided to start a return-tax-for-fun program. The program is simple: on each day, Roger picks some non-empty group of citizens and returns to them the taxes they paid that day. However, picking some random citizens is not very fun, and Roger has always been fond of the number KK and its multiples, so he decided to only pick groups of citizens such that the product of the taxes returned to them is a multiple of KK. Among all such choices, he picks a group which minimises the sum of the returned taxes (he does not want to waste too much money).\nWe know that Roger is a moody person. Sometimes, he chooses two integers 1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N and decides that he will not consider the citizens numbered LL through RR for the return-tax-for-fun program, i.e. the sum of returned taxes should be the smallest possible among all groups that do not contain any of these citizens. Roger told Melanie, his secretary, to do all the work and report to him the smallest sum of taxes that should be returned. Now, Melanie is looking for your help.\nYou should answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given the integers LL and RR and you should compute the smallest sum of taxes that should be returned or determine that there is no way to choose a group of citizens such that the product of the taxes returned to them is a multiple of KK. Note that the queries are independent \xe2\x80\x94 a citizen that is not considered for the return-tax-for-fun program in one query may be considered for the program again in subsequent queries.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NN, QQ and KK.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nQQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers LL and RR describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the smallest returned sum, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to pick a valid group of citizens.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4108\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4108 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 5 24\n6 3 12 2 8\n3 3\n2 4\n3 4\n1 3\n2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n11\n14\n11\n-1\n14\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kmaaszraa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MKIT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, Divisors, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3159\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

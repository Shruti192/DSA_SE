b'\nYou are given a binary string AA of length NN. Rearrange the binary string to form binary strings SS and TT such that the length of the longest common substring between SS and TT is minimum.\nPrint both strings SS and TT.\nNote that both SS and TT must be anagrams of AA \xe2\x80\x94 see the examples below for more clarity.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of two lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the binary string AA.\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string AA of length NN.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, output two lines. The first line contains string SS while the second line contains string TT. Both strings SS and TT must be anagrams of string AA and thus, have length NN.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\nSum of NN over all cases does not exceed 30003000.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n101\n4\n1111\n4\n0111\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n110\n011\n1111\n1111\n1101\n0111\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: The given string is A=101A=101. Two rearrangements of AA such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are S=110S=110 and T=011T=011. The longest common substring between strings SS and TT is 1111, having length 22. It can be proved that for no other pair of rearrangements of string AA, the LCS has a length less than 22.\nTest case 22: The given string is A=1111A=1111. Here, all rearrangements of AA are the same. Two rearrangements of AA such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are S=1111S=1111 and T=1111T=1111. The longest common substring between strings SS and TT is 11111111, having length 44.\nTest case 33: The given string is A=0111A=0111. Two rearrangements of AA such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are S=1101S=1101 and T=0111T=0111. The longest common substring between strings SS and TT is 0101 having length 22. It can be proved that for no other pair of rearrangements of string AA, the LCS has a length less than 22.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85notsoloud\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MINSUB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy-medium, greedy, march222, notsoloud, pigeonhole, strings, substring\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2412\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-01-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

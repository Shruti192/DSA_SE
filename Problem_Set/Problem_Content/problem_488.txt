b'\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a tree with NN nodes rooted at node 11, and your task is to color each node of the tree either white or black. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), let wiwi be the number of white nodes that occurs in a simple path from the root node to ithith node and bibi be the number of black nodes that occurs in a simple path from the root node to ithith node. The cost of a node ii is defined as the absolute difference between wiwi and bibi. \nThe cost of the tree is defined as the summation of the cost of all the nodes in the tree. The value of the tree is defined as the absolute difference between the total number of white nodes and the total number of black nodes in the tree. You have to color the tree in such a way that the cost of the tree is minimized.\nYour task is to answer a single query QQ, such that:\n\nIf Q=1Q=1, Determine the maximum value the tree can have after minimizing the cost of the tree.\nIf Q=2Q=2, Determine the minimum value the tree can have after minimizing the cost of the tree.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The TT test cases then follow:\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NN and QQ, denoting the number of nodes in the tree and the query to answer respectively.\nThe next N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain two space-separated integers uu and vv, denoting that there is an edge between the node uu and the node vv.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the answer to the query. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa421\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n,u\xe2\x89\xa0v1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n,u\xe2\x89\xa0v\n\xe2\x88\x91N\xe2\x88\x91N over all test cases does not exceed 105105.\nIt is guaranteed that the given nodes and edges form a tree.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nQ=1Q=1\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points):\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n5 2\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Color the node 11 with black color and color the nodes 2,3,4,52,3,4,5 with white color to get the minimum cost of the tree, that is 33, and the maximum value of the tree, that is 33.\nTest case 2: Color the nodes 1,41,4 with black color and color the nodes 2,3,52,3,5 with white color to get the minimum cost of the tree, that is 33, and the minimum value of the tree, that is 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85mexomerf\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREUPS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy-medium, ltime101, mexomerf, trees\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2613\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

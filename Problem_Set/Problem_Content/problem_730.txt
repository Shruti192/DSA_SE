b'\nAbhishek is working in one of the best telecommunication companies of the world. He joined this company recently. To test his skills, his boss assigned him to help two of their customers: Aryan and Ali. \nInitially both of their phone numbers are empty (fantasy world you see). During each day , one of the following things can take place:\n\nLast digit of numbers of either Aryan or Ali can be erased.\nA new digit can be appended at the end of the numbers of either Aryan or Ali.\n\nThe company also has a magical number MM of length NN, where each digit is between 00 and 99 (both inclusive). The positions of digits are numbered from 11 to NN, from left to right. Aryan and Ali will be happy if both of their numbers appear as non-overlapping subsequences of MM.\nMore formally, suppose that Aryan chooses some positions from MM such that the digits at those positions form his current number (in the same order).Let the positions be a1,a2,a3,...,apa1,a2,a3,...,ap . Now , Ali chooses some positions, not already chosen by Aryan such that the digits at those positions form his current number (in the same order).Let the positions be b1,b2,b3,...,bqb1,b2,b3,...,bq. Then the following conditions should hold true :\n\naiai as well as bibi are strictly increasing sequences.\nFor all pairs (ai,bj)(ai,bj) 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p, 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4q1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4q, ai\xe2\x89\xa0bjai\xe2\x89\xa0bj.\nValues of aiai  are pairwise distinct. 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p.\nValues of bibi  are pairwise distinct. 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4q1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4q.\nMa1Ma2Ma3....MapMa1Ma2Ma3....Map forms Aryan\'s number.\nMb1Mb2Mb3....MbqMb1Mb2Mb3....Mbq forms Ali\'s number.\n\nOver a period of DD days, Abhishek has to follow one of the following instructions each day:\n\nappendappend xx yy : You have to append digit yy to the end of xx\'s number.\neraseerase xx : Erase the last digit from xx\'s number. \n\nAbhishek has to help these customers over a period of DD days. As he is a new employee, he asks for your help.\nFor each of the DD days, you have to tell whether the phone numbers of Aryan and Ali appear as non-overlapping subsequences of MM.\nNOTE : Prefer using fast I/O methods, as the input is large.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain two spaced integers NN , DD\nThe next line will contain the magical number MM of length NN\nDD lines follow. Each of these lines will contain either of the following:\nappendappend xx yy : You have to append digit yy to the end of xx\'s number.\neraseerase xx : Erase the last digit from xx\'s number. \n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint DD lines. On the ithith line, print "YES" (without quotes) if both Aryan and Ali will be happy after the ithith day otherwise print "NO" (without quotes). You can print any character of the answer in any case, ie "yes", "YeS", "nO","No" etc will be considered valid response. \n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\nThe length of numbers of Aryan and Ali does not exceed 103103 \nMM consists of digits from 00 to 99.\nxx is either Aryan or Ali.\nyy can be any digit from 00 to 99.\nDuring the erase operation, the corresponding person\'s number is non empty.\nThe numbers of Aryan, Ali and even the magical number MM can contain leading zeroes.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 4\n0013\nappend Aryan 1\nappend Ali 0\nappend Ali 3\nappend Aryan 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\n\nAt the end of first day, Aryan\'s number is 11 , while Ali\'s number is empty. Since 11 can be obtained as a subsequence of MM, Aryan is happy. Ali is also happy(as his number is empty).\nAt the end of second day, numbers of Aryan and Ali are 11 and 00 respectively. Aryan can choose the subsequence formed by the digit at position 33 while Ali can choose the digit at position 11 . Since these are distinct positions , both will be happy.\nAt the end of third day, numbers of Aryan and Ali are 11 and 0303 respectively. Aryan can choose the same position as before, while Ali can choose positions 11 and 44. As these are distinct positions, both will be happy.\nAt the end of forth day, numbers of Aryan and Ali are 1919 and 0303 respectively. Since Aryan cannot choose any subsequence , he will be unhappy (Ali still being happy).   \n\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7 10\n9784831\nappend Aryan 9\nappend Ali 7\nappend Aryan 8\nappend Aryan 1\nappend Ali 8\nappend Ali 4\nappend Ali 4\nappend Ali 0\nerase Ali\nerase Ali\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85need_for_code\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LCKALI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Jump Pointers, Dynamic Programming, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Pre processing, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3084\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

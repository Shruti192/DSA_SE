However, the oven is special \xe2\x80\x95 you need a password to open it.\nLet\'s define a function f(x)f(x) for a positive integer xx as follows:\n\nConsider the decimal representation of xx (without leading zeros). Split it into the minimum number of contiguous subsequences of digits such that in each subsequence, all digits are identical.\nFor each subsequence, look at its position in the original decimal representation of xx. Let\'s say that the most significant digit it contained was the ee-th digit, where e=0e=0 corresponds to the least significant digit of xx. For example, 388,822,442388,822,442 can be split into subsequences "3", "888", "22", "44", "2", where e=7e=7 for the sequence "888" and e=4e=4 for the sequence "22".\nThe value of a subsequence which contains a digit dd repeated one or more times is d\xe2\x8b\x8510ed\xe2\x8b\x8510e.\nf(x)f(x) is the sum of values of these subsequences. For example, f(388,822,442)=3\xe2\x8b\x85108+8\xe2\x8b\x85107+2\xe2\x8b\x85104+4\xe2\x8b\x85102+2\xe2\x8b\x85100f(388,822,442)=3\xe2\x8b\x85108+8\xe2\x8b\x85107+2\xe2\x8b\x85104+4\xe2\x8b\x85102+2\xe2\x8b\x85100.\n\nThe oven has a screen which displays two long integers LL and RR (with NLNL and NRNR digits respectively, without leading zeros). The password is the sum of f(x)f(x) for each xx between LL and RR inclusive.\nChef does not have a lot of time, so he asks for your help. Please find the password for the oven so that he can start cooking as fast as possible. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NLNL and LL.\nThe second line contains two space-separated integers NRNR and RR.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the password.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4NL,NR\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4NL,NR\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R<10100,0001\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R<10100,000\nLL and RR do not contain leading zeros\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nR\xe2\x88\x92L\xe2\x89\xa4105R\xe2\x88\x92L\xe2\x89\xa4105\nR<1018R<1018\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points): R<1018R<1018\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 9\n2 97\n1 8\n2 12\n1 1\n1 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4681\n49\n36\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 2: f(8)=8,f(9)=9,f(10)=10,f(11)=10,f(12)=12f(8)=8,f(9)=9,f(10)=10,f(11)=10,f(12)=12\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85claudy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ENCODING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Digit DP, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2351\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-04-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

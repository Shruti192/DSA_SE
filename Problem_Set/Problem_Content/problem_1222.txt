b'\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, and Russian as well.\nThere are NN players participating in a knockout tournament. The ii-th player has the rating AiAi. No two players have the same rating.\nN\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 matches are played in the tournament. In each match, 22 random players are chosen out of the remaining players, and the player with the higher rating wins. The losing player gets eliminated from the tournament.\nCan you find out the expected rating of the player ending up at the second position (that is, the expected rating of the player losing in the (N\xe2\x88\x921)(N\xe2\x88\x921)-th match)? \nThe expected rating of the second player can be represented as a fraction of the form PQPQ. You are required to print P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921(mod1000000007)P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921(mod1000000007). \nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains TT - the number of test cases.

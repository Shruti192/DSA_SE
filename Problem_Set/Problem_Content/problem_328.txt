b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere is a straight road that passes through N short tunnels. At the entrance to the first tunnel, there are C cars lined up in a row waiting to enter the series of tunnels. The distance between each pair of consecutive tunnels is D metres (the lengths of each tunnel and each car are negligible) and the velocity of each car is S metres per second.\nEach tunnel contains a toll booth. In the i-th tunnel (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N), processing a car at the toll booth takes Ai seconds. Only one car can be processed at the same time. If there are multiple cars in the tunnel, they all have to wait for the first car to be processed; afterwards, the first car exits the tunnel, the second car starts being processed and all remaining cars have to wait again, etc. Whenever a car arrives in a tunnel, it has to wait at that tunnel's toll booth until all previous cars have been processed and then get processed itself.\nThe road and the tunnels are too narrow, so cars can't overtake each other at any time during the journey.\nChef is after Reziba once again. Reziba's car is the first car to enter the tunnels, while Chef's car is the last car to enter the tunnels.\nCompute the final delay (in seconds) between the first (Reziba's) car and the last (Chef's) car immediately after Chef's car exits the last tunnel, i.e. after all the cars have passed through the tunnels. This delay is equal to the distance between the first and the last car divided by the cars' velocity, or equivalently to the difference between the times when the last car and the first car exit the last tunnel.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of tunnels.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the time taken for processing a car at each toll booth.\nThe third line contains three space-separated integers C, D and S.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one real number \xe2\x80\x94 the time delay between the first and last car after all the cars have passed through all the tunnels. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error is less than 10-6.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109 for each valid i\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 C \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 D, S \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1:\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1,000\nC = 2\nSubtask #2: Original Constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n2 2 2\n3 5 5\n2\n3 2\n2 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4.000000000\n3.000000000\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Each car takes 5/5 = 1 second to go from one tunnel to the next tunnel.\nSince each car has to wait for equally long (2 seconds) in each tunnel, the delay between every two consecutive cars exiting each tunnel is 2 seconds.\nAs there are 3 cars, the total time delay between the first and the last car after the last tunnel is 4 seconds.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85abizerl123\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85r_64\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CARPTUN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1714\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

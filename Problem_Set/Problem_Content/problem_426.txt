b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nAn even sequence has the following property: each maximal contiguous subsequence which contains only equal integers (i.e. the same integer repeated a number of times) has an even length. In particular, the empty sequence is even. A subsequence is maximal if it is not contained in a larger contiguous subsequence which contains only equal integers.\nChef was given an integer sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN by his friend Mr. Z. He may perform the following operation any number of times: either delete an element of the current sequence (if it is non-empty) or insert an integer anywhere in the current sequence (possibly at the beginning or at the end).\nFind the minimum number of operations needed to make the sequence even.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851062\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa418N\xe2\x89\xa418\nSubtask #2 (10 points): Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Ai+1Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Ai+1 for each valid ii\nSubtask #3 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa43,000N\xe2\x89\xa43,000\nSubtask #4 (20 points): Ai\xe2\x89\xa426Ai\xe2\x89\xa426 for each valid ii\nSubtask #5 (40 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n1 1 2 1\n11\n2 2 2 10 2 10 1 1 5 3 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Here are two ways to make the sequence even using 22 operations:\n\nDelete the first element 11 and the only element 22, resulting in a sequence (1,1)(1,1), which is even.\nDelete the last element 11 and insert 22 at the end, resulting in a sequence (1,1,2,2)(1,1,2,2), which is even.\n\nIt can be proved that one operation is not enough to make the initial sequence even.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85sanroylozan\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EVSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy-medium, ltime91, sanroylozan, taran_1407\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

Can she eat all the loaves of bread before they expire?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case consists of a single line containing three integers NN, MM and KK - the number of loaves of bread Eikooc has, the number of days after which all the breads will expire and the number of loaves of bread Eikooc can eat in a day.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output Yes if it will be possible for Eikooc to eat all the loaves of bread before they expire. Otherwise output No.\nYou may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,K\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,K\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n100 100 1\n9 2 5\n19 6 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Eikooc can eat one loaf of bread per day for 100100 days. Thus none of the bread expires.\nTest case 2: Eikooc can eat 55 loaves of the first day and 44 loaves on the second day. Thus none of the bread expires.\nTest case 3: There is no way Eikooc can consume all the loaves of bread before it expires.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85the_hyp0cr1t3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EXPIRY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, math, start34, the_hyp0cr1t3\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n440\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\n          \n            Some integers satisfy following condition: \n They can be represented as sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.  \nI will name this condition as 'beautiful' in further statement. \n\nFor instance, 10 can be represented as sum of 1+2+3+4. \n\nGiven an integer N, find XOR of Nth integer that satisfies the beautiful condition with the maximum number smaller than this Nth integer that does not satisfy beautiful condition. \nFor instance, if N is 1, then 1st number in the set of integers that satisfies beautiful condition is 3. The maximum number smaller than 3 that does not satisfy the condition is 2. XOR of 3 and 2 is 1. \nPlease note that value of Nth number won't exceed 600 in this problem. \nInput : \n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single integer NN. \n\nOutput : \nFor each testcase, output a single integer, according to the query asked above. \n\nConstraints\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4500\n\nSample Input :\n3  \n1  \n2  \n10 \n\nSample Output :\n1 \n1 \n6\nExplanations :\nCase\xc2\xa0#1Case\xc2\xa0#1 : Explained in problem statement. \nCase\xc2\xa0#2Case\xc2\xa0#2 :  The second integer that satisfies the condition is 5.

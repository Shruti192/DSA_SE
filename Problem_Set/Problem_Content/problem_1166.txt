b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a combination lock with NN wheels (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, on the ii-th wheel, the integers from 00 to AiAi (inclusive) are written in ascending order (00 and AiAi are also adjacent). Initially, one value on each wheel is selected uniformly randomly and independently.\nThe lock operates in a very peculiar way: it opens when there is at least one wheel where either 00 or the largest value on that wheel is selected. Chef wants to open the lock using the smallest possible number of operations; in one operation, he may choose one wheel and rotate it clockwise or counterclockwise by 11 unit (i.e. select a value that is adjacent to the previously selected value on that wheel).\nFind the expected value of the number of operations which Chef needs to perform to open the lock.\nThe expected number of operations can be represented as a fraction PQPQ, where PP is a non-negative integer and QQ a positive integer coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353. You should calculate P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of QQ modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai<998,244,3520\xe2\x89\xa4Ai<998,244,352 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa45,000N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\nAi\xe2\x89\xa45,000Ai\xe2\x89\xa45,000 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa45,000N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000\n\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n2 2\n2\n5 5\n3\n3 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n443664157\n221832079\n598946612\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85choudhary463\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFSSM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Generating Functions, Polynomial, Lagrange Interpolation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Sequences and Progression, Algebra, Calculus, Interpolation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2745\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-07-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

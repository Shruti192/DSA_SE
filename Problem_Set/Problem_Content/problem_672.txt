b"\nSuppose that you have several powers of two, specifically, you have AiAi numbers equal to 2i2i for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N. You want to divide all of these numbers into two groups with equal sum. However, it's not always possible.\nTo make it possible, in one operation you are allowed to choose any 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N and receive an extra number 2i2i (in other words, you can increase any AiAi by 11). Let's define f(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN)f(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN) as the smallest number of operations that you need to make to be able to split the numbers into two groups with equal sums.\nYou are given NN integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN. Find the sum of f(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN)f(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN) over all tuples (A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN)(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN) with 0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Bi0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Bi (there are (B1+1)(B2+1)\xe2\x80\xa6(BN+1)(B1+1)(B2+1)\xe2\x80\xa6(BN+1) of them). As this number may be very large, output it modulo 998244353998244353.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT, the number of test cases.

We have f(0,0,0)=0f(0,0,0)=0 (there are no numbers, so divide them into two empty sets), and f(0,1,0)=1f(0,1,0)=1 (we have one number, namely 21=221=2. Use one operation to receive a second copy of 2121 and then place these copies in different sets). The answer is thus 0+1=10+1=1\nTest case 22: There are 66 tuples, with their function values as follows:\n\nf(0,0,0)=0f(0,0,0)=0\nf(0,0,1)=1f(0,0,1)=1 (receive 2222)\nf(1,0,0)=1f(1,0,0)=1 (receive 2020)\nf(1,0,1)=2f(1,0,1)=2 (receive 2020 and 2121, then split as {20,20,21}{20,20,21} and {22}{22}, both with sum 44)\nf(2,0,0)=0f(2,0,0)=0\nf(2,0,1)=1f(2,0,1)=1 (receive 2222)\n\nAdd all these up to get 55, which is the output.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntrygub_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SPLITPOWOF2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook141, dynamic-programming, greedy, trygub_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2709\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

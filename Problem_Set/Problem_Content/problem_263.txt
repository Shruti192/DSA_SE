b"\nIn Quartzland recently a new collection of toys went on sale. This collection consists of  109  types\nof toys, numbered with integers from  1  to  109 . A toy from the new collection of the  i\xc2\xadth type\ncosts  i  quartz.\nRiku has managed to collect N  different types of toys  A1 , A2... AN  from the new collection.\nToday is Riku's birthday, and her mother decided to spend no more than M  quartz on the\ngift to the daughter. Riku will choose several different types of toys from the new collection\nas a gift. Of course, she does not want to get a type of toy which she already has.\nRiku wants to have as many distinct types of toys in her collection as possible as the result.\nThe new collection is too diverse, and Riku is too little, so she asks you to help her in this.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains 2 space separated integers N and  M \xe2\x80\x94 the number\nof types of toys that Riku already has and the number of quartz that her mom is willing to\nspend on buying new toys.\nThe second line contains  N  distinct integers  A1 , A2...AN \xe2\x80\x94 the types of toys that Riku already has.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output two lines as follows:\nIn the first line print a single integer  K  \xe2\x80\x94 the number of different types of toys that Riku\nshould choose so that the number of different types of toys in her collection is maximum\npossible. Of course, the total cost of the selected toys should not exceed M.\nIn the second line print  K  distinct space\xc2\xad separated integers  X1 , X2... XK\xe2\x80\x94 the\ntypes of toys that Riku should choose.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3 7\n1 3 4\n4 14\n4 6 12 8\n \nOutput:\n2\n2 5\n4\n1 2 3 5\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Riku's mom should buy two toys: one toy of the  2\xc2\xadnd type and one toy of the  5\xc2\xadth\ntype. At any other purchase for  7  quartz (assuming that the toys of types  1 ,  3  and  4  have\nalready been bought), it is impossible to buy two and more toys.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85puneetguptaa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDX1605\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, greedy, implementation, puneetguptaa\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-07-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

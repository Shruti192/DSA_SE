b'\n"This world is rotten. The rotten should die." - Kira.\nYou have "N" shinigamis and "M" apples. You need to give a positive number of apples to every shinigami and also make sure that every shinigami receives a distinct number of apples. Find out the number of ways in which you can distribute all M apples.Two ways are same if every shinigami gets the same number of apples.\nInput\nThe first line contains "T" , the number of test cases. Each of the next "T" lines contains two integers, "N" and "M" , as stated in the question.\nOutput\nFor each of the "T" test cases, output the required ans. Since the answer can be very big , output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007).\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 300\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1 2\n2 2\n\nOutput:\n1\n0\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nTest case #1:\nWe have only one basket , where we can put the 2 apples. This can be done in only one way.\nTest case #2:\nWe have two baskets but only two apples. We cannot obtain a partition with distinct and positive apples for each shinigami.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nskullcrackers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SHINAPP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, ipc151a, ipcquestion, maths, skullcrackers\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-10-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

Each chef can, alone, give birth to many younger chefs, which can then give birth to even younger chefs, and so on. It is easy to see that the family structure of any chef (formed by this chef's direct and indirect descendants) is a tree.\nA family is a tree such that its root does not have a parent, i.e. it is not a proper subtree of any tree. In a valid family tree, the age of each chef that has a parent is strictly smaller than the age of this chef's parent. The respect of a family is the age of the oldest chef in this family. The respect of Chefland is the sum of respects of all families in Chefland.\nA long time ago, there were several families in Chefland. All their data was stored in the Cookbook; the families were represented by listing all the (undirected) edges in all family trees and the ages of all chefs. Since all family trees were valid, it was always possible to deduce the exact parent-child relations.\nOver many years, the book got contaminated \xe2\x80\x94 people added some extra edges (possibly zero) between some chefs. Currently, there are NN chefs in the book (numbered 11 through NN; note that no chefs were added) and MM undirected edges between them.\nYoung Chef is now wondering: what could the respect of Chefland have been, as originally described in the Cookbook? Consider all ways to remove a (possibly empty) set of edges such that the resulting graph contains only valid families. For each possible kk, find the sum of respects of Chefland over all the ways such that the resulting graph contains exactly kk families. Since these numbers may be large, compute them modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, where AiAi denotes the age of the ii-th chef.\nEach of the next MM lines contains two space-separated integers UU and VV denoting an edge in the Cookbook between chefs UU and VV.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid kk, the kk-th of these integers should denote the sum of respects over all the ways to remove edges such that the number of families is exactly kk, modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45,0002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000\nthe sum of MM over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe graph described on the input does not contain any self-loops or multiple edges\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): \n\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5050\nthe sum of MM over all test cases does not exceed 1818\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points): the graph described on the input is a valid family \nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 1\n1 2\n1 2\n3 2\n3 2 4\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 3\n0 14 9\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There is one way to have exactly 11 family and the respect of that family must be 22.\nThere is one way to have exactly 22 families. These families must have respects 11 and 22, so the respect of Chefland for 22 families must be 1+2=31+2=3.\nExample case 2: There is no way to have exactly 11 family.\nThere are two ways to have 22 families, with respects 33 and 44 (the same for both ways). Therefore, the answer for 22 families is 2\xe2\x8b\x85(3+4)=142\xe2\x8b\x85(3+4)=14.\nThere is only one way to have 33 families, with respects 33, 22 and 44. Therefore, the respect of Chefland for 33 families must be 3+2+4=93+2+4=9.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85deva2802\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GRAPHTRE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graphs, Advanced DP\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2893\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

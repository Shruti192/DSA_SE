Today, he accepted Samir's challenge of planting 20 million trees by 2020. Currently, there are NN trees (numbered 11 through NN) planted at distinct positions on a line; for each valid ii, the position of the ii-th tree is AiAi.\nA set of trees is beautiful if for each tree in this set (let's denote its position by xx), there is a tree at the position x\xe2\x88\x921x\xe2\x88\x921 and/or a tree at the position x+1x+1.\nKerim's task is to plant some (possibly zero) trees in such a way that the resulting set of all planted trees (the initial NN trees and those planted by Kerim) is beautiful. It is only allowed to plant trees at integer (possibly negative) positions. Find the minimum number of trees he needs to plant in order to achieve that.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of trees Kerim needs to plant.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN are pairwise distinct\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa41,000N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nAi\xe2\x89\xa42,000Ai\xe2\x89\xa42,000 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 104104\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n2 7 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Kerim should plant trees at the positions 33 and 66 to make the grid beautiful, so the answer is 22.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mrkerim\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DEADEND\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1656\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-11-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

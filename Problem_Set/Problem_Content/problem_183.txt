b'\nRead problem statement in Mandarin chinese and Vietnamese.\nSuzumo is the coach of the ChefLand OI team. Physical condition is very important in any olympiad, so he wants to make the children run a bit as a warmup.\nThe team consists of NN children numbered 11 through NN standing at some positions on the xx-axis. For each valid ii, the initial xx-coordinate of the ii-th kid is xixi, the running velocity of the ii-th kid is constant and equal to vivi.\nSuzumo wants to assign a running direction (left or right, i.e. in the direction of decreasing or increasing xx-coordinate) to each kid; the children start running at time 00 in the assigned directions. Afterwards, Suzumo will measure the smallest time tt at which some kid passes another one. Help Suzumo compute the maximum time tt if he can assign the directions arbitrarily!\nNote: Child ii passes child jj at time tijtij if their coordinates satisfy xi<xjxi<xj at any time t<tijt<tij and xi>xjxi>xj at any time t>tijt>tij, or if they satisfy xi>xjxi>xj at any time t<tijt<tij and xi<xjxi<xj at any time t>tijt>tij.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nNN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xixi and vivi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one real number \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible time tt, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is possible to assign directions in such a way that no kid ever passes another. Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error less than or equal to 10\xe2\x88\x92610\xe2\x88\x926.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,vi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4xi,vi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nno two children have the same initial positions\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n10 10\n20 30\n30 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One optimal assignment of directions is left, right, right.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RUNDIR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Sorting, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2379\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-04-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

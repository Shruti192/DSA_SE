b'\nAfter his marriage when one day chef was talking to his wife he found that she liked a lot of riddles. One day she told him about power of a string and asked him to solve a problem for her. \nHis wife told him the following things about the KthKth power of a string \nThe KthKth power of a string ii is denoted as ikik and this string ikik is obtained by concatenating KK copies of the string II. This means that i(k+1)=ik.ii(k+1)=ik.i, (where . denotes concatenation and i^0 is an empty string). The Chef is given a string ss, it is required to measure how \xe2\x80\x98far\xe2\x80\x99 it is from the kth power of some string. The Chef is only allowed to replace some characters in the string by others. The Chef is also given a number KK, it is required for him to find the minimum number of replacements needed so that the resulting string is the kth power of some string. It can be assumed that the length of the given string is a multiple of kk. Help Chef to find the minimum number of replacements. \nInput:\nThe first line of input will contain the given string. It can be assumed that the characters in the string are all small letters a,...,za,...,z. The second line of input will contain a number k\xe2\x89\xa52k\xe2\x89\xa52 that divides the length of the string. \nOutput:\nThe first line of output should contain the answer, the minimum number of replacements needed to convert the string into a kthkth power.\nConstraints :\nLength of s<=20000s<=20000\nk>=2k>=2\nTime limit is around 11 seconds.                                                                                 \nSample Input 1:\nabaababa\n4                                                                                  \nSample Input 2:\nabcabcab\n2                                                                                                                                    \nSample Output 1:\n3\nSample Output 2:\n4\nExplanation for sample test 1:\nHere k=4, therefore we have to find minimum replacement in 4 strings ab, aa, ba and ba to make them all equal, so we can see that the number of replacements will be 3 (we can make them all equal to ba)\nExplanation for sample test 2:\nHere k=2, therefore there are 2 strings abca and bcab we have to make both strings equal so we can make both of them equal to abca. So the number of replacements are 4. (Change all characters of 2nd string bcab to abca)\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85beast787\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFSTRI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 beast787, greedy, math, medium, strings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

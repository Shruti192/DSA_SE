b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is the leader of Chef's Earth Defense Organization, and his mission is to counter aliens which are threatening the earth. According to information gathered by the organization, there are NN alien spaceships (numbered 11 through NN) planning to invade the earth. The ii-th spaceship will appear on the radar at time CiCi. Each spaceship needs DD time to reach earth once it appears on the radar. \nChef's organization owns a huge laser cannon which can destroy one spaceship in one shot. However, once the cannon is used once it needs some amount of cool-down time in order to be used again (first shot doesn't require cool-down time before it is used). This cool-down time, however, is configurable. It has to be set before the first shot, and cannot be changed after that. If Chef sets a lower cool-down time, that would increase the energy consumed by the cannon, and vice-versa - the higher the cool-down time, the lower the energy consumed.\nThis might be a long battle, and Chef wants to use as little energy as possible. So Chef wants to maximize the cool-down time while still being able to destroy all spaceships before any of them arrive on earth. In particular, the ii-th spaceship should be shot between the times CiCi and Ci+DCi+D (both end points inclusive).\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NN and DD. \nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CNC1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CN.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one real number\xe2\x80\x95 the maximum cool-down time possible. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error of the answer does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92610\xe2\x88\x926.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4109\nThe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): \n\nN\xe2\x89\xa41,000N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 10,00010,000\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): Original constraints\nSample Input:\n2\n3 2\n3 2 3\n2 1\n5 6\n\nSample Output:\n1.5000000000\n2.0000000000\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ALIENIN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2244\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

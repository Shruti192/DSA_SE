b'\nThere are NN students in a class. Recently, an exam on Advanced Algorithms was conducted with maximum score MM and minimum score 00. The average score of the class was found out to be exactly XX.  \nGiven that a student having score strictly greater than the average receives an A grade, find the maximum number of students that can receive an A grade.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe only line of each test case consists of three integers N,M,XN,M,X - the number of students, the maximum score and the average score respectively.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line, the maximum number of students who can receive A grade.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41072\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4107\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 100 50\n3 100 50\n5 40 40\n10 50 49\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: There are 22 students in the class. One of the possible values of scores is [99,1][99,1]. Here, the average score is 99+12=1002=5099+12=1002=50. Only the first student receives an A grade. It can be shown that the maximum number of students receiving an A grade is not more than 11.\nTest case 22: There are 33 students in the class. One of the possible values of the scores is [60,20,70][60,20,70]. Here, the average score is 60+20+703=1503=5060+20+703=1503=50. The students receiving an A grade are students 11 and 33. It can be shown that the maximum number of students receiving an A grade is not more than 22.\nTest case 33: There are 55 students in the class. The average score and the maximum score is 4040. Thus, the scores of all the students is 4040. Since the score of all the students is equal to the average, none of them receive an A grade.\nTest case 44: It can be shown that the maximum number of students receiving an A grade does not exceed 99.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ABOVEAVG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 math, start37, utkarsh_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1278\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-05-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

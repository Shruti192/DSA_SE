b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nMike takes part in programming contests. His favourite topic is dynamic programming(DP). As he said, that he likes problems on DP, because "you spend a lot of time on thinking and a little time on coding".\nIn this problem you are to solve a version of the knapsack problem(link), one of the most famous examples of DP problem.\nYou are given N items, each has two parameters: a weight and a cost. Let\'s define M as the sum of the weights of all the items.\nYour task is to determine the most expensive cost of a knapsack, which capacity equals to 1, 2, ..., M. A cost of a knapsack equals to the sum of the costs of all the elements of the knapsack. Also, when you have a knapsack with a capacity is equal to C, then you can fill it with items, whose sum of weights is not greater than C.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains one integer N, denoting the number of the items.\nThe next N lines contain two integers W and C each, denoting the weight and the cost of the corresponding item.\nOutput\nFor each capacity C (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 C \xe2\x89\xa4 M) of the knapsack, output a single integer - the most expensive cost for that capacity.\nConstraints\n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000;\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 W \xe2\x89\xa4 2, for each item;\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 C \xe2\x89\xa4 109, for each item.\nExample\nInput:\n5\n1 1\n2 2\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n\nOutput:\n1 5 6 9 10 12 13 14 15 \n\nExplanations\nIn the test case, M equals to 9.\nFor C = 1, it\'s optimal to choose {1} items;\nFor C = 2, it\'s optimal to choose {5} items;\nFor C = 3, it\'s optimal to choose {1, 5} items;\nFor C = 4, it\'s optimal to choose {4, 5} items;\nFor C = 5, it\'s optimal to choose {1, 4, 5} items;\nFor C = 6, it\'s optimal to choose {3, 4, 5} items;\nFor C = 7, it\'s optimal to choose {1, 3, 4, 5} items;\nFor C = 8, it\'s optimal to choose {2, 3, 4, 5} items;\nFor C = 9, it\'s optimal to choose {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} items.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kostya_by\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85rustinpiece\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KNPSK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2239\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-05-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

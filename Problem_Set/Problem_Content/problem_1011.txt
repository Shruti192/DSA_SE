b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef and his competitor Kefa own two restaurants located at a straight road. The position of Chef\'s restaurant is X1X1, the position of Kefa\'s restaurant is X2X2.\nChef and Kefa found out at the same time that a bottle with a secret recipe is located on the road between their restaurants. The position of the bottle is X3X3.\nThe cooks immediately started to run to the bottle. Chef runs with speed V1V1, Kefa with speed V2V2.\nYour task is to figure out who reaches the bottle first and gets the secret recipe (of course, it is possible that both cooks reach the bottle at the same time).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers X1X1, X2X2, X3X3, V1V1 and V2V2. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Chef" if Chef reaches the bottle first, "Kefa" if Kefa reaches the bottle first or "Draw" if Chef and Kefa reach the bottle at the same time (without quotes). \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|X1|,|X2|,|X3|\xe2\x89\xa4105|X1|,|X2|,|X3|\xe2\x89\xa4105\nX1<X3<X2X1<X3<X2\n1\xe2\x89\xa4V1\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4V1\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4V2\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4V2\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 3 2 1 2\n1 5 2 1 2\n1 5 3 2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nKefa\nChef\nDraw\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

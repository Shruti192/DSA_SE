b'\nA Cement Factory has been set up by the Ashutosh Pratap.  In this Factory there are NN stations for transport of cement from one chamber to another chamber. Each Chamber or Each station has a specific height hihi  and each adjacent station are separated by some distance didi . d1d1=distance between building 2 and 1 . So you have two arrays one having NN heights of the stations in the factory and another array of NN-1 numbers denoting the distance between two adjacent elements of the previous array.  where didi= distance between ii+1th station and iith station.\nNow as you have gone through the concepts of Gravity so hired mechanical engineers arbitrarily build passing chambers which support transportation between any pair of stations . As the decision was very quick so they build TT transportation gateways between some stations. Each such transportation gateway is denoted by uu to vv . But here when a sack of cement goes from station uu to vv then total cost spent is (hvhv-huhu)*(distance between station u and station v). \nNow when cement sack flows down it looses energy and it is in free small so instead of spending some positive amount it will get something while going down. Thus flowing up and flowing down might cost you not the same always.\nAlso you know that from which building to which other building you can transport the sack of cement. \nNow Ashutosh hired you as a computer science engineer to solve his problem of finding minimum amount he will spent  in transporting a cement sack from a srcsrc source to any other station SiSi which he gives you in the form of SS queries. and in each query he asks you what is the minimum amount of transporting of cement sack from srcsrc source to the given station in the query SiSi.\nIf the amount can be infinitely minimum then simply output -1 as the answer for all query. \nIf the cement sack cannot reach from srcsrc station to SiSi station anyhow then simply output 1000000000000. Amount to transport a cement sack from source to source maybe 0 if and only if no other minimum cost is possible.\nRemember uu to vv is not same as transportation gateway between vv to uu.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NN, number of stations.

Next lines follow description of queries.\nThis line contains SS space separated  numbers SiSi denoting the destination station.\n\nOutput:\nFor each SS queries find the minimum cost to transport sack of cement from srcsrc source to destination SiSi\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4108\n0\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa41050\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4src\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4src\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input:\n    4\n    1 4 3 2\n    2 3 5\n    4\n    1 2 \n    2 3\n    2 4\n    1 4\n    1\n    4\n    1 2 3 4\n\nSample Output:\n    0\n    6\n    3\n    -10\n\nEXPLANATION:\nObserve it Yourself!

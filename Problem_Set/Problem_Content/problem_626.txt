b'\nThe fight between Sardar Khan and Sultan to control Wasseypur is getting very intensifying. Sultan has asked Ramadhir to supply him with automatic guns in an attempt to dominate the battlefield. The Sardar family must also buy automatic guns or risk annihilation.\nThe gun merchant Sardar is buying guns from has NN guns in stock, the ii-th of which has type AiAi. He sells these guns according to the following peculiar rules:\n\nOnly one person can buy guns at a time.\nFor all 1<i\xe2\x89\xa4N1<i\xe2\x89\xa4N, he will sell the ii-th gun only if the (i\xe2\x88\x921)(i\xe2\x88\x921)-th gun has already been sold to somebody. The first gun can be sold directly with no restriction.\nOnce some guns are sold to a person and they leave, they will not be allowed to come back in later and purchase any more guns.\n\nAs a result, any buyer can only own a consecutive set of guns - if the first unsold gun when they enter has index LL, they can only buy guns L,L+1,L+2,\xe2\x80\xa6,RL,L+1,L+2,\xe2\x80\xa6,R where L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4NL\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N, and the choice of RR is left to them.\nSardar Khan wants his lackeys to visit the gun merchant and buy all the guns. The intimidation power of a lackey is the number of distinct types of guns in his possession. The total intimidation power Sardar Khan gets from his lackeys is the product of all of their individual intimidation powers (to ensure this value is non-zero, only consider the product over all lackeys who purchase at least one weapon from this merchant).\nSardar can send as few or as many lackeys to the merchant as he likes, as long as every weapon is purchased by at least one of them.\nSardar obviously would like to maximize his intimidation power. Find out what this maximum value is, given that his lackeys buy guns optimally. The answer can be large, so print it modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT lines follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN, the number of guns the merchant has for sale.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers, A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN; where AiAi is the type of the ii-th gun.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the maximum intimidation power Sardhar can achieve, modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NN over all test cases is less than or equal to 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n7\n1 1 1 2 3 4 9\n10\n1 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 6 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n24\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1\nThe first lackey buys the guns (1,1)(1,1). The second lackey buys (1,2)(1,2) and the third lackey buys (3,4,9)(3,4,9). The number of unique guns the lackeys now have are 1,2,31,2,3 respectively.\nThe total intimidation power Sardar Khan gets is 1\xe2\x8b\x852\xe2\x8b\x853=61\xe2\x8b\x852\xe2\x8b\x853=6. \nAnother possible distribution achieving the same value is (1,1,1,2)(1,1,1,2) and (3,4,9)(3,4,9) which requires only 22 lackeys.\nIt can be verified that there is no way to achieve a higher value.\n\xc2\xa0\nTest Case 2\nThe first lackey buys the guns (1,2,3)(1,2,3).

Therefore, he is trying to find ways to update the infrastructure in the country. One possible way is to move all materials from Discuss to Discourse.\nChef will have access to Discourse if his knowledge and power become exactly equal to NN and MM respectively. Initially, he has power 11 and knowledge 11.\nChef can perform actions of the following types to improve his skills:\n\nsolve a problem \xe2\x80\x94 increase his knowledge by XX\ndo a push-up \xe2\x80\x94 increase his power by YY\ninstall ShareChat to keep in touch with friends \xe2\x80\x94 increase both knowledge and power by 11\n\nChef can only install ShareChat at most once. The remaining actions may be performed any number of times and the actions may be performed in any order.\nHelp Chef find out whether it is possible to move from Discuss to Discourse.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers NN, MM, XX and YY.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Chefirnemo" if it is possible to reach the required knowledge and power or "Pofik" if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n2 2 1 2\n11 10 5 9\n11 11 5 9\n12 11 5 9\n1 2 1 100\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nChefirnemo\nChefirnemo\nPofik\nChefirnemo\nPofik\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 2: We add Y=9Y=9 once to the power to get power 1010. We add X=5X=5 twice to the knowledge to get knowledge 1111.\nExample case 3: We can see that it is impossible to reach power M=11M=11 no matter which or how many operations we do. Note that the ShareChat operation will increase both knowledge and power by 11, and hence it will still be impossible to attain the given values of knowledge and power at the same time.\nExample case 4: We can reach knowledge 1111 and power 1010 like in example case 2, the only difference is that we also use the ShareChat operation to increase both by 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFADV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Divisibility, Linear Algebra, Arithmetic\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic, Algebra, Basic Maths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1462\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

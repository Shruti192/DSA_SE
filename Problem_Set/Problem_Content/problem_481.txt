b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef loves to make dishes. Currently, he has NN ingredients (numbered 11 through NN) which he can use to cook various dishes.\nTo make a dish, Chef must use exactly KK ingredients in a correct order. Therefore, a dish is a sequence of KK distinct integers between 11 and NN. The tastiness of that dish is defined as the GCD of these integers (all the ingredients in that dish). Chef wants to choose a dish uniformly randomly and cook it.\nYou should answer QQ queries. KK is the same for all queries. In each query, you are given NN and you should find the expected value of the tastiness of Chef's dish or determine that Chef cannot cook any dish.\nIf Chef can cook at least one dish, it can be proven that this expected value is a fraction in the form P/DP/D, where PP and DD are coprime positive integers and DD is coprime with 109+7109+7. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85D\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85D\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+7109+7, where D\xe2\x88\x921D\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of DD modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers QQ and KK.\nEach of the next QQ lines contains a single integer NN describing a query.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 P\xe2\x8b\x85D\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85D\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+7109+7, or 00 if Chef cannot cook any dish.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q,N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4Q,N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nK=2K=2 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n\nSubtask #2 (15 points): K=2K=2\nSubtask #3 (75 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 2\n1\n2\n4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n166666669\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first query, it is impossible to cook a dish with two ingredients if N=1N=1.\nIn the second query, Chef can cook two dishes: (1,2)(1,2) and (2,1)(2,1). The tastiness of each of these dishes is 11, so the expected value of tastiness is 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85kharyusuf\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EXPGCD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Divisors, Combinatorics, Inclusion Exclusion Principle, Mobius Inversion\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Set Theory, Integer Factorisation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2245\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-07-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

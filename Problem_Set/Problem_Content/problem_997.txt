Chef\'s friend Dustin gave him binary strings SS and RR, each with length NN, and told him to make them identical. However, unlike Dustin, Chef does not have any superpower and Dustin lets Chef perform only operations of one type: choose any pair of integers (i,j)(i,j) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N and swap the ii-th and jj-th character of SS. He may perform any number of operations (including zero).\nFor Chef, this is much harder than cricket and he is asking for your help. Tell him whether it is possible to change the string SS to the target string RR only using operations of the given type.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains a binary string SS.\nThe third line contains a binary string RR.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to change SS to RR or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa44001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4400\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n|S|=|R|=N|S|=|R|=N\nSS and RR will consist of only \'1\' and \'0\'\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\n11000\n01001\n3\n110\n001\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef can perform one operation with (i,j)=(1,5)(i,j)=(1,5). Then, SS will be "01001", which is equal to RR.\nExample case 2: There is no sequence of operations which would make SS equal to RR.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ezio_26\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PLAYSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arrays, Frequency Arrays\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1108\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-07-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

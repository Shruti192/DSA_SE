b"\nYou are given a tree with NN vertices. The vertices are numbered from 11 to NN. Some of the vertices are colored black and some are colored red. Also, some vertices can be uncolored. There is at least one black and at least one red vertex.\nCompute the number of subsets of vertices WW such that:\n\nEach vertex in WW is uncolored.\nWW is a connected subgraph of the tree.\nIf you remove all the vertices of set WW, there will be at least one pair of vertices (u,v)(u,v) such that uu is black and vv is red, and there is no path from uu to vv.\n\nOutput your answer modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the number of vertices.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting an edge between vertices uu and vv.\nThe next line contains NN space-separated integers denoting the colors of the vertices. The ithith of these integers is 00 if vertex ii is uncolored, 11 if it's black, or 22 if it's red.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer denoting the number of ways to select a valid subset WW, modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nSum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 106106\n\nExample Input\n2\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n3 6\n0 1 0 1 2 0\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n3 6\n1 0 0 0 2 0\n\nExample Output\n5\n2\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: The possible subsets WW are {1}{1}, {3}{3}, {1,3}{1,3}, {3,6}{3,6} and {1,3,6}{1,3,6}.\nTest Case 2: The possible subsets WW are {3}{3} and {3,6}{3,6}.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BLREDSET\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-11-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

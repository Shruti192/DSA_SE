b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nThere are N cards placed in a row, where every card has two numbers written on it, one on the top and \none on the bottom. The numbers are between 1 and N (both inclusive). Every number is written on the top of exactly one card, and on the bottom of exactly one card as well.\n\nChef wants to rearrange the cards, such that the length of the longest common contiguous subsequence between the sequence formed by number written on top of the cards, and that formed by those written on the bottom is maximum. He can't modify the numbers written on any card and can't flip the cards, that is, for any card the number written on top remains at the top and the number written on bottom stays at the bottom. Find out the maximum possible length of the common contiguous subsequence.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test\ncase contains an integer N.\nThe next line contains N space separated  integers A1,  A2, ... , AN, where Ai(1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N) is the number written on the top of the i-th card.\nThe next line contains N space separated  integers B1,  B2, ... , BN, where Bi(1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N) is the number written at the bottom of the  i-th card. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the integer L: the maximum length of the longest common contiguous subsequence.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4  100 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4  2000 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai, Bi \xe2\x89\xa4  N \nAll the elements in both arrays A and B are distinct.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1 3 2\n2 1 3\n8\n3 8 4 2 6 1 5 7\n5 2 4 3 8 7 6 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n\n\nExplanation\n\nFirst Example :  \nOne of the possible card arrangements is: \n1 2 3 \n2 3 1 \n\nLength of the longest common contiguous subsequence between [1, 2, 3] and [2, 3, 1] is 2, [2, 3]. And that's the maximum possible, so answer is 2.\n\n\nSecond Example:  \nOne of the possible card arrangements is : \n7 3 2 8 6 5 4 1 \n1 5 3 2 8 6 4 7 \n\nThe longest common contiguous subsequence has length 4 [3, 2, 8, 6] here. There is no way to arrange these cards such that it's more than 4.\n\nNote\nLet L be the answer. Let Ci be the value written on the top of the card at ith position and Di be the value written on the bottom of the card at ith position after rearranging. Then, there should be a pair (x, y) (1 ? x,y ? N-L+1) such that the condition  Cx+j = Dy+j is satisfied for all j, where 0 ? j < L.\n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\nimran_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CARDLINE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Longest Common Substring, Greedy, Cycles\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP on sequences, Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3092\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-07-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nLittle Elephant and his friends are going to a party. Each person has his own collection of T-Shirts. There are 100 different kind of T-Shirts. Each T-Shirt has a unique id between 1 and 100. No person has two T-Shirts of the same ID.\nThey want to know how many arrangements are there in which no two persons wear same T-Shirt. One arrangement is considered different from another arrangement if there is at least one person wearing a different kind of T-Shirt in another arrangement.\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains a single integer  T  denoting number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.\nFor each test case, first line contains an integer N, denoting the total number of persons. Each of the next N lines contains at least 1 and at most 100 space separated distinct integers, denoting the ID's of the T-Shirts ith person has.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print in single line the required number of ways modulo 1000000007 = 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2\n3 5\n8 100\n3\n5 100 1\n2\n5 100\n\nOutput:\n4\n4\n\nExplanation\nFor the first case, 4 possible ways are (3,8), (3,100), (5,8) and (5,100).For the second case, 4 possible ways are (5,2,100), (100,2,5), (1,2,100), and (1,2,5).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85darkshadows\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TSHIRTS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Bitmask, Bitmasking\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2242\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-02-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nYou play the following game against a devilishly clever opponent. On the table, there are two bowls \xef\xac\x81lled with glass beads. In each move, depending on whose turn it is, you or your opponent can do one of the following.\n\nMove one bead from the \xef\xac\x81rst bowl to the second bowl.\nRemove one bead from the second bowl.\n\nAt any point in the game, let xx denote the number of beads in the \xef\xac\x81rst bowl and yy denote the number of beads in the second bowl. If x+yx+y is even, it is your turn to move. If x+yx+y is odd, it is your opponent\xe2\x80\x99s turn to move\nAt each position of the game, you get some points that depend on the number of beads, xx and yy, in the two bowls. This is given by a function f(x,y)=Ax2+By2+Cxyf(x,y)=Ax2+By2+Cxy, where A,BA,B and CC are integers that are \xef\xac\x81xed each time the game is played.\nThe game starts with MM beads in the \xef\xac\x81rst bowl and NN beads in the second bowl. As the game progresses, beads are removed. The game ends when both bowls are empty.\nYour score for the game is the sum of the values f(x,y)f(x,y) for each position (x,y)(x,y) that the game passes through, starting from (M,N)(M,N) and ending with (0,0)(0,0). Your aim is to obtain as high a score as possible, no matter what moves your opponent chooses. Remember that your opponent is \xef\xac\x81endishly ingenious and will always play in such a way as to minimize your score.\nFor example , suppose the game starts with 22 beads in each bowl and the score function is f(x,y)=x2\xe2\x88\x92y2\xe2\x88\x92xyf(x,y)=x2\xe2\x88\x92y2\xe2\x88\x92xy : that is, A=1,B=\xe2\x88\x921A=1,B=\xe2\x88\x921 and C=\xe2\x88\x921C=\xe2\x88\x921. Here are some plays of the game\xe2\x80\x94the positions where you choose the move are enclosed in boxes and the positions where your opponent moves are not enclosed in boxes.\n\nIn this particular game, the best possible score that you can achieve if you consider all possible moves that your opponent can choose is \xe2\x88\x9222\xe2\x88\x9222. Recall that your devilishly clever opponent always plays in such a way that your score is minimized.\nInput Format\nThe input consists of a single line containing \xef\xac\x81ve integers, M,N,A,BM,N,A,B and CC where MM and NN are the number of beads initially in the \xef\xac\x81rst and second bowl, respectively and A,BA,B and CC are the coefficients of the score function f(x,y)=Ax2+By2+Cxyf(x,y)=Ax2+By2+Cxy\nOutput Format\nThe output should be a single integer, the maximum score that you can achieve in this game.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,\xe2\x89\xa46001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,\xe2\x89\xa4600\n\xe2\x88\x921000\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa41000\xe2\x88\x921000\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 2 1 -1 -1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-22\n\n\nExplanation\nExplained in Statement\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85yogesh01\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-12-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

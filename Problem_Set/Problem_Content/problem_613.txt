b'\nOmy and Ish were learning the pattern printing. In order to learn they give themselves a task. In this task they are given a string and they have to form a pyramid with the pattern as follows:\nRowNumber are one based indexed.\n\nIf (RowNumber % 3 == 0) then string is written in left to right while in other cases it is written in right to left order.\nif the string end it will be started again and end of the pyramid need not to be the end of string.\n\nFor eg: string is \xe2\x80\x9cCODINGCODING\xe2\x80\x9d and height of pyramid is \xe2\x80\x9c55\xe2\x80\x9d\n          C\n         D O\n        I N G\n       I D O C\n      D O C G N\n\nOmi will be asked QQ queries and he has to tell the frequency of a character  C in that particular row RR of pyramid.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NN, height of pyramid.\nNext line contain a string consists only of Uppercase English Alphabets, length not exceed 106106\nThird line contain a single integer QQ, the number of queries to be asked.\nEach query contain two space separated integers, RR and CC, where RR is the row number and CC is the character.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each query, output in a single line the frequency of the alphabet in the given row.\n\nConstraints:\n\n11 \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 NN \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 1010^1818\n11 \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 QQ \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 5000050000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N\nA\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa4ZA\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa4Z\n\nSample Input:\n 5\n CODING\n 2\n 1 C\n 2 D\n\nSample Output:\n 1\n 1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85nitika_789\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PATTERNG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, lico2020, mathematics, medium, nitika_789\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

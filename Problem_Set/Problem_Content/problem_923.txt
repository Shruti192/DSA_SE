b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYesterday, puppy Tuzik learned a magically efficient method to find the sum of the integers from 1 to N. He denotes it as sum(N). But today, as a true explorer, he defined his own new function: sum(D, N), which means the operation sum applied D times: the first time to N, and each subsequent time to the result of the previous operation.\nFor example, if D = 2 and N = 3, then sum(2, 3) equals to sum(sum(3)) = sum(1 + 2 + 3) = sum(6) = 21.\nTuzik wants to calculate some values of the sum(D, N) function. Will you help him with that?\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing two integers D and N.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, output one integer on a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 16\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 D, N \xe2\x89\xa4 4\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10\n21\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85pavel1996\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kostya_by\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PPSUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Loops, Basic Maths, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n961\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

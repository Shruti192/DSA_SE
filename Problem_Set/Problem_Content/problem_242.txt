b'\nChef in association with Netaji Subhash Engineering College , decided to conduct a coding contest CODE-O-WAR for its students , to overcome the boredom during the Quarantine .\nThere are NN students in the college. The number of students is even. The ithith student has programming skill equal to AiAi.\nChef wants to form N/2N/2 teams with certain restrictions which goes as :\n\nEach team should consist of exactly two students, and each student should belong to exactly one team.\nTwo students can form a team only if their skills are equal .\n\nStudents can solve problems to increase their skill. One solved problem increases the skill by one.\nChef wants to know the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly N/2N/2 teams (i.e. each pair of students should form a team). Your task is to help Chef in finding out the minimum number of problems to be solved.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, an integers NN. \nNext line contains NN space integer AiAi,denoting skills of ithith student.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, print the minimum no. of problems to be solved .\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4100000\nNN  is always Even\n\nSample Input:\n   1\n   2 \n   1 100\n\nSample Output:\n    99\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shrivas7\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COW203\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cowc2020, greedy, shrivas7\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a string AA of length NN, consisting of zeroes and ones. You want to partition it into blocks consisting of consecutive indices such that each block has an odd sum and has length at most mm. For each mm from 11 to NN, find the minimum number of blocks required, or report that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines:\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string A=a1a2\xe2\x80\xa6aNA=a1a2\xe2\x80\xa6aN. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print NN space-separated integers. The mm-th of these integers should be the minimum number of blocks of length at most mm the array can be partitioned into, such that each block has an odd sum, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to do so.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\nThe sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 106106.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (9 Points): The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 200200.\nSubtask 2 (13 Points): The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 25002500.\nSubtask 3 (21 Points): The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 1500015000.\nSubtask 4 (17 Points): The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 5000050000.\nSubtask 5 (24 Points): The sum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 250000250000.\nSubtask 6 (16 Points): No additional constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n01101\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-1 3 3 3 1\n\n\nExplanation\nClearly if m=1m=1, no such partitioning is possible, as the first block must consist of a single 00.\nFor m=2,3,4m=2,3,4, we can partition it as 0110101101. Note that 0110101101 is also a valid partition.\nIf m=5m=5, the partition consisting of a single block 0110101101 is valid as the total sum (33) is odd.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85um_nik\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PARTODD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Observation, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3426\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nVed started playing a new mobile game called Fighting Clans. An army of NN enemies is approaching his base. The ithith enemy has HiHi health points. An enemy gets killed if his health points become 00.\nVed defends his base using a weapon named Inferno. He can set the Inferno to one of the following two modes:\n\nSingle-Target Mode: In one second, the Inferno can target exactly one living enemy and cause damage of at most XX health points.\nMulti-Target Mode: In one second, the Inferno can target all living enemies and cause damage of 11 health point to each of them.\n\nFind the minimum time required to kill all the enemies.\nNote: Ved is not allowed to change the mode of the weapon once it is set initially.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NN and XX - the number of enemies and the damage caused by the single-target mode of Inferno in one second respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers H1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6,HNH1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6,HN where HiHi denotes the initial health points of ithith enemy.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line, the minimum time required to kill all the enemies.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n5 4\n2 2 4 1 1\n3 5\n5 4 5\n4 4\n4 4 4 4\n3 10\n7 8 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n4\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: In single-target mode, all enemies can be killed in 11 second each. Thus, in single-target mode, the total time required is 55 seconds.\nIn multi-target mode:\n\nAfter one second, the health points of the enemies are: [1,1,3,0,0][1,1,3,0,0]. Enemies 44 and 55 are dead after one second.\nAfter two seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [0,0,2,0,0][0,0,2,0,0].\nAfter three seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [0,0,1,0,0][0,0,1,0,0].\nAfter four seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [0,0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThus, 44 seconds are required to kill enemies using multi-target mode. The minimum time required to kill all the enemies is 44 seconds.\nTest case 2: In single-target mode, all enemies can be killed in 11 second each. Thus, in single-target mode, the total time required is 33 seconds.\nIn multi-target mode:\n\nAfter one second, the health points of the enemies are: [4,3,4][4,3,4].\nAfter two seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [3,2,3][3,2,3].\nAfter three seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [2,1,2][2,1,2].\nAfter four seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [1,0,1][1,0,1].\nAfter five seconds, the health points of the enemies are: [0,0,0][0,0,0].\n\nThus, 55 seconds are required to kill enemies using multi-target mode. The minimum time required to kill all the enemies is 33 seconds.\nTest case 3: Here, single-target mode will take 44 seconds and multi-target mode will also take 44 seconds. Therefore, the minimum time required is 44 seconds.\nTest case 4: Here, single-target mode will take 33 seconds, while multi-target mode will take 99 seconds. Therefore, the minimum time required is 33 seconds.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85jeevanjyot\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INFERNO\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 jeevanjyot, math, start37\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1162\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-05-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

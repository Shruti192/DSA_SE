b"\nRead problems statements in mandarin chinese and vietnamese as well.\nSereja is stuck with a problem and asks for your help. You readily agree to help Sereja and he poses the following problem to you. \nSereja has a matrix  A of size N x N. Each cell in row i and column j contains a number A[i][j]. Every element of the matrix can either be 0 or 1. Initially, all the elements are zero. \nSereja informs you that he only likes the functions of the form\n\nHere the division is integer division, i.e. x/y means integer division of x by y.\n\nSereja can choose a set of integers a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, d and two other integers l, r and applies the function f to the matrix as follows. He will substitute 1 in the every cell (i, j) where l \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 r and j = f(i).\nSereja gives you a matrix A after applying a certain number of functions to it. He asks you to find the minimal amount of functions such that after applying them Sereja will get the matrix A. You need not create the matrix A exactly, you are allowed to have at most 100 distinct cells in the matrix obtained after your operations and the matrix A. Your task is to minimize the number of such functions applied.\nInput\n The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case contains an integer N. Each of the next N lines contains N digits (zero or one) without spaces denoting the matrix A.\nOutput\nFor each test case in first line output an integer corresponding to the number of functions Q.\nNext Q lines should contain information about functions. Each lines should contain set of integers a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, d, l, r. \nThe following constraints must be satisfied for the output.\n\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 N*N\n-N \xe2\x89\xa4 a1, b1, c1, d \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a2, b2, c2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 l \xe2\x89\xa4 r \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\nTests generation\nThere will be 10 official tests. During contest you will be able to get your score on first 2 tests. After contest there will be rejudge on full tests set. \n\nIn every test, T is equal to 20 and N is chosen randomly in the range [95, 100]. Further for each test case integer K is chosen: \n\nFor first 5 tests, K is chosen randomly in range [1, 5]\nFor next 5 tests, K is chosen randomly in range [50, 100]\nFor next 5 tests, K is chosen randomly in range [500, 1000]\nFor next 5 tests, K is chosen randomly in range [1000, 3000]\n\n\n\nAfter K is chosen we generate K functions in next way:\n\nWith probability 1/3, a1 = b1 = 0\nWith probability 2/3, a1 = 0\nFor all other numbers, the way of generation is hidden\n\n\nScoring\nYou will receive a WA if the operation doesn't satisfy the output constraints specified in the statement or the number of distinct cells in the final matrix after applying all the operations exceeds 100. \nLets S denote the sum of Q / (N * N + 1 - ONES) (where ONES is number of digit 1 in given matrix) for all the test cases. Your score will be to S which you should try to minimize. \nExample\nInput:\n1\n5\n00010\n00100\n01000\n10000\n11111\n\nOutput:\n2\n0 1 0 1 -1 1 5 1 4\n0 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsereja_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SEAFUNC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 challenge, greedy, math, sept17, sereja_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3775\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-11-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\nYou are given an array of size NN, consisting only of -1 and 1.Your task is to make the sum of the array equals to 0. To make the sum 0, you can do ONEONE of the following operation in EACHEACH step.\n\nReplace -1 by 1. \nReplace 1 by -1.  \n\nAlso, you will see that it's NotNot always possible to make the sum 0, if it's impossible to make the sum 0, print  \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 as a result.\nNote:Note: Array will only contain \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 and +1+1 as the elements.\nInput:\n\nFirst line of input will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nFirst line of each testcase contains single integer NN. \nSecond line of each test case contains NN space separated integers, elements of the array. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output a single line integer, minimum number of steps required to make sum 0, or print -1 if it's impossible to make the sum 0.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n4\n6\n1 1 1 -1 -1 -1\n5\n-1 -1 1 1 1\n4\n1 1 1 1\n8\n-1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 1 -1  \nSample Output:\n0\n-1\n2\n1\nEXPLANATION:\nCase\xc2\xa0#1Case\xc2\xa0#1 : the sum is already 0, so you don't need to perform any step.  \nCase\xc2\xa0#2Case\xc2\xa0#2 : number of '+1' is 3 and number of '-1' is 2, whatever steps you may perform you cannot make sum equals to 0.  \nCase\xc2\xa0#3Case\xc2\xa0#3 : number of '+1' is 4 and number of '-1' is 0, so you can replace two '+1' by '-1' in two steps. So, finally there are two '+1' and two '-1' in the array, whose the sum is 0.   \nCase\xc2\xa0#4Case\xc2\xa0#4 : number of '+1' is 3, and number of '-1' is 5, so after replacing one '-1' by '+1', we will get four '-1' and four '+1', whose sum is 0.  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85prasoonjain006\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MINSTEP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, heat2021, math, prasoonjain006\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

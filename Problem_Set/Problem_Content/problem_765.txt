b'\nChef has opened a new ice cream parlor. His friend Chefina is going to visit the parlor very soon. Chef knows that Chefina is going to order a triple sundae on her visit. However, he does not know which flavors she would order.\nChef has three storage containers with capacities X,YX,Y and ZZ respectively. Each container can store multiple flavors of ice cream. Since Chef does not know which flavors Chefina would order, he wants to store maximum number of flavors in the storage containers. \nChef has a total of NN flavors. In order to store the ithith flavor, Chef must select exactly one container and fill it with CiCi amount of flavor ii. \nNote that the total amount of ice cream filled in a container should not exceed its capacity.\nFind the maximum number of flavors Chef can store in the containers.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains four integers N,X,YN,X,Y and ZZ.\nThe next line contains NN integers, where the ithith integer denotes CiCi.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the maximum number of distinct flavors Chef can store using the three containers.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y,Z\xe2\x89\xa415001\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y,Z\xe2\x89\xa41500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa415001\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa41500\nSum of NN overall test cases does not exceed 20002000.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 12 16 15\n11 8 5 10 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 11: \n\nStore flavor {4}{4} in container XX, since 10\xe2\x89\xa4|X|10\xe2\x89\xa4|X|.  \nStore flavors {1,3}{1,3} in container YY, since (11+5)=16\xe2\x89\xa4|Y|(11+5)=16\xe2\x89\xa4|Y|.\nStore flavors {5}{5} in container ZZ, since 9\xe2\x89\xa4|Z|9\xe2\x89\xa4|Z|. \nThis way we can store 44 flavors.\n\nThere can be other ways to store 44 flavours but we cannot store more than 44 flavours.\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 4 5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 22:\n\nStore flavor {4}{4} in container XX, since 4\xe2\x89\xa4|X|=44\xe2\x89\xa4|X|=4.\nStore flavors {2,3}{2,3} in container YY, since 2+3=5\xe2\x89\xa4|Y|=52+3=5\xe2\x89\xa4|Y|=5.\nStore flavors {5}{5} in container ZZ, since 5\xe2\x89\xa4|Z|=55\xe2\x89\xa4|Z|=5. \nThis way we can store 44 flavors.\n\nIt can be proven that we cannot store more than 44 flavors in this case.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85sg1729\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TPT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 bitset, dynamic-programming, medium, sg1729, start29\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3274\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

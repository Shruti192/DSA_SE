b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef found a strange string yesterday - a string of signs s, where each sign is either a '<', '=' or a '>'. Let N be the length of this string. Chef wants to insert N + 1 positive integers into this sequence and make it valid. A valid sequence is a sequence where every sign is preceded and followed by an integer, and the signs are correct. That is, if a sign '<' is preceded by the integer a and followed by an integer b, then a should be less than b. Likewise for the other two signs as well. \nChef can take some positive integers in the range [1, P] and use a number in the range as many times as he wants.\nHelp Chef find the minimum possible P with which he can create a valid sequence.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains the string of signs s, where each sign is either '<', '=' or a '>'. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the minimum possible P. \nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, |s| \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of |s| over all test cases in a single test file \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, |s| \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of |s| over all test cases in a single test file \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points)\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n<<<\n<><\n<=>\n<=<\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2\n2\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nHere are some possible valid sequences which can be formed with the minimum P for each of the test cases:\n1 < 2 < 3 < 4\n1 < 2 > 1 < 2\n1 < 2 = 2 > 1\n1 < 2 = 2 < 3\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFSIGN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Substring\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Groupings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1563\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-11-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

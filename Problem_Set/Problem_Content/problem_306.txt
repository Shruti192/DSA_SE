b"\nHaving solved the first problem chef's wife has decided to make things tough for him, she tells him the following things about the KthKth power of a string                  \nThe kthkth power of a string ii is denoted as ikik and the string ikik is obtained by concatenating kk copies of the string ii. The string i(k+1)=ik.ii(k+1)=ik.i, where ++ denotes concatenation and i^0 is an empty string. The Chef is given a string s, it is required to measure how \xe2\x80\x98far\xe2\x80\x99 it is from the kth power of some string.                                                                               \nHowever this time The Chef is also allowed to add characters at the end of the string, along with replacing existing characters. This time Only the string is given and the Chef has to find the minimum number of operations needed to change the string into a power of some string .An operation is either a replacement or addition of a character at the end. Note that k must be at least 2, otherwise the answer can always be 1. Help Chef solve this problem.\nInput:\nThe first line of input will contain the given string. It can be assumed that the characters in the string are all small letters a,...,z.a,...,z.\nOutput:\nThis should contain two numbers, the minimum number of operations required and the value of k such that the string is converted to a kth power. If there is more than one possible value of k, with the same number of operations, output the smallest one.\nConstraints :\nLength of s<=20000s<=20000\nk>=2k>=2\nTime limit 5seconds5seconds.\nSample Input 1:\nabaababa\n4\nSample Input 2:\nabcabcab\n2 \nSample Output 1:\n2 2\nSample Output 2:\n1 3\nExplanation for sample test 1:\nWe can add 2 characters ab at the end of the string. So the new string becomes abaababaab, which is the 2nd power of string abaab. We can see that minimum operations will be 2 and minimum value of k is 2.\nExplanation for sample test 2:\nWe can add 1 character c at the end of the string. So the new string become abcabcabc, which is the 3rd power of string abc. We can see that minimum operations will be 1 and minimum value of k is 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85beast787\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFSTR2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 beast787, greedy, math, medium-hard, strings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nChef wants to reach home as soon as possible. He has two options:\n\nTravel with his BIKE which takes XX minutes.\nTravel with his CAR which takes YY minutes.\n\nWhich of the two options is faster or do they both take same time?\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line of input, two integers X,YX,Y representing the time taken to travel with BIKE and CAR respectively.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print CAR if travelling with Car is faster, BIKE if travelling with Bike is faster, SAME if they both take the same time.\nYou may print each character of CAR, BIKE and SAME in uppercase or lowercase (for example, CAR, Car, cAr will be considered identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa410\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 5\n4 2\n6 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nBIKE\nCAR\nSAME\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case-1: Travelling with BIKE takes 11 minute while travelling with CAR takes 55 minutes. So travelling with BIKE is faster.\nTest case-2: Travelling with BIKE takes 44 minutes while travelling with CAR takes 22 minutes. So travelling with CAR is faster.\nTest case-3: Travelling with both BIKE and CAR takes the SAME time i.e. 66 minutes.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRAVELFAST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, math, start26, utkarsh_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n571\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

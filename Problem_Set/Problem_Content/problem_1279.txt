b"\nBob has taken a contract to complete two walls w1w1 and w2w2. Since, previous builder left the walls incomplete, bob needs the complete the walls. Formally, the two walls will be having height w1w1 and w2w2 before Bob starts the work.   \nThe height of a wall increases by one unit with each brick kept on top of this wall. \nBob has kk number of bricks with him and he needs to spend all of these bricks in building both the walls such that height w1w1 is strictly greater than w2w2. If he satisfies above condition, his job is completed.\nCount the number of possibilities such that he completes his job.\nPlease note that it's NotNot mandatory for Bob to keep bricks on both the walls. He can also keep all the bricks on alternative wall leaving one of them of initial height. You only need to tell the number of possibilities such that :-\n\nAllAll bricks are used, and w1w1 > w2w2 \n\nHave a look at the sample test cases for more clarification.  :)\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains three integers w1w1, w2w2,  and kk, the initial height of respective walls and the number of bricks, Bob has.  \nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 108108.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output an integer denoting number of possibilities such that Bob completes his job\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4w1\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4w1\xe2\x89\xa4108\n1\xe2\x89\xa4w2\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4w2\xe2\x89\xa4108\n0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41080\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4108\n\nSample Input:\n3\n5 3 4\n2 1 0\n3 5 5\nSample Output:\n3\n1\n2\nEXPLANATION:\nCase\xc2\xa0#1Case\xc2\xa0#1 :  In the first test case, the number of possibilities are (7,5), (9,3) and (8,4).  \nCase\xc2\xa0#2Case\xc2\xa0#2 : Here, since kk=0, so number of possibility is only (2,1).  \nCase\xc2\xa0#3Case\xc2\xa0#3 :  Here, the number of possibilities are (8,5), (7,6). you cannot make any other combination by using all bricks and with w1w1 > w2w2.  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85maazbinasad3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FIR123\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 brute-force, easy, maazbinasad3, math\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-03-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef's loves his dog so much! Once his dog created two strings a and b each of length n consisting of digits 1 and 2, and even a problem about them!\nChef's Dog will tell by barking if a string x (also containing only digits 1 and 2 and with length N) is good or not by performing the following actions.\n\nIt starts at first digit of the string, i.e. at i = 1. \nIt can move from digit i to either i - 1 or i + 1 if xi equals 1 and the corresponding digits exist. \nIt can move from digit i to either i - 2 or i + 2 if xi equals 2 and the corresponding digits exist. \nIt must visit each digit exactly once. \nIt must finish at the last digit (XN). \n\n\nChef's dog wants to make both the strings a and b good by choosing some subset S (possibly empty) of indices of set {1, 2, ..., n} and swapping each index i \xcf\xb5 S between string a and b, i.e. swapping ai and bi. Can you find how many such subsets S exist out there? As the answer could be large, output it modulo 109 + 7.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line contains string a.\nThe second line contains string b.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing answer of the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |a| = |b| \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n'1' \xe2\x89\xa4 ai, bi \xe2\x89\xa4 '2'\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (30 points) |a|, |b| \xe2\x89\xa4  10\nSubtask #2 (70 points) original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1111\n2211\n222\n111\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1.\nPossible subsets are: \n{}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {3}, {4}, {3, 4}.\n\nTest case 2.

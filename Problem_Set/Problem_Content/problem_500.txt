b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. The sequence is circular, i.e. for each valid ii, elements AiAi and Ai+1Ai+1 are considered adjacent, and elements A1A1 and ANAN are also considered adjacent. Initially, each element of this sequence is either 11 or 00.\nYou may perform some operations on this sequence. In one operation, you should choose an index ii such that Ai=1Ai=1 and move that 11 to one of its adjacent elements, i.e. change AiAi to 00, choose one of the elements adjacent to AiAi and increment it by 11.\nAccording to Chef, a sequence is good if all its elements are different from 11. You have to tell Chef the minimum number of operations needed to turn the sequence AA into a good sequence or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of required operations, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to make the sequence good.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41063\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851062\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nN=1,000N=1,000\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 104104\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n0 0 0\n4\n1 0 1 0\n5\n1 1 0 1 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The sequence is already good, so the answer is zero.\nExample case 2: We can make the sequence good in two operations, e.g. [1,0,1,0]\xe2\x86\x92[0,1,1,0]\xe2\x86\x92[0,0,2,0][1,0,1,0]\xe2\x86\x92[0,1,1,0]\xe2\x86\x92[0,0,2,0].\nExample case 3: We can make the sequence good in three operations, e.g. [1,1,0,1,0]\xe2\x86\x92[0,2,0,1,0]\xe2\x86\x92[0,2,1,0,0]\xe2\x86\x92[0,3,0,0,0][1,1,0,1,0]\xe2\x86\x92[0,2,0,1,0]\xe2\x86\x92[0,2,1,0,0]\xe2\x86\x92[0,3,0,0,0].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFZRON\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Loops, Dynamic Programming, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Basic Programming Concepts, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2786\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

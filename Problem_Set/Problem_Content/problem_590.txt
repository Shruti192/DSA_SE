b'\nYou are given an array A=[A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN]A=[A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN] containing NN elements. You are also given QQ ordered pairs of integers, where the ii-th pair is denoted (xi,yi)(xi,yi).\nA subsequence of AA, say [Ai1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aik][Ai1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aik], is said to be magical if the following condition is satisfied:\n\nFor each 1\xe2\x89\xa4j<k1\xe2\x89\xa4j<k, (Aij,Aij+1)(Aij,Aij+1) must be among the given QQ pairs. That is, each consecutive pair of elements in this subsequence must be among the given QQ pairs.\n\nFind the length of the longest magical subsequence of AA, and print the indices of one such longest subsequence. \nIf there are multiple longest magical subsequences, you may print the indices of any of them.\nNote: Array contains at least one valid subsequence of length greater than or equal to 22.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN, denoting the length of the array.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.\nThe third line of each test case contains an integer QQ, denoting the number of pairs.\nThe ii-th of the next QQ lines contains two space-separated integers xixi and yiyi \xe2\x80\x94 the ii-th ordered pair.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print two lines.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer KK \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the longest magical subsequence of AA. \nThe second line should contain KK space-separated integers in ascending order, denoting the indices of the magical subsequence you found.\n\nIn case there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4106\nThe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.\nThe sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n7\n1 3 2 8 3 7 6\n5\n3 7\n3 3\n3 8\n8 7\n8 6\n5\n1 2 1 2 1\n5\n2 1\n3 1\n1 1\n3 2\n1 2\n4\n1 2 1 4\n5\n1 3\n1 1\n1 4\n2 4\n4 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 4 7 \n5\n1 2 3 4 5 \n3\n1 3 4 \n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11:  The length of the longest magical subsequence is 33.

Adjacent elements are (1,2)(1,2) and (2,1)(2,1), both of which are in the given pairs.\nTest case 33: The length of the longest magical subsequence is 33. One such subsequence of length 33 is [1,1,4][1,1,4], with indices [1,3,4][1,3,4]. Adjacent elements are (1,1)(1,1) and (1,4)(1,4), which are among the given pairs.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85mystic_ankush\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85tejas10p\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MSUB121\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Subsequence\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Groupings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3072\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\nThere are NN players in a team playing a famous mobile game Codechef Users' Battlegrounds (CUBG). Each player in the team needs guns to fight the other teams. To use guns the players need ammunition (or ammo). Initially, each player ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) of the team has AiAi units of ammo. Before they get into any fight, the team leader wanted to make sure that each player has equal amount of ammo (i.e., all AiAi should be the same). There's only two ways he can do so:\n\nExchange 11 unit of ammo between two teammates.\nAsk a teammate to loot 11 unit of ammo from a nearby building.\n\nEach of the above operations can be performed any number of times (including zero). Also, each type of operation takes 11 unit of time to complete. Note that it is not allowed for a player to drop some ammo on the ground (i.e. the total units of ammo cannot decrease).\nSince there's not much time left before the other teams approach, you have to help the leader figure out the minimum time needed to make sure all the teammates have equal units of ammo.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then TT the test cases follow. \nFirst line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nSecond line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,...,ANA1,A2,...,AN.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line the required answer.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n3\n4\n7 8 6 4\n6\n7 3 10 2 3 8\n1\n10  \nSample Output:\n4\n10\n0  \nExplanation:\nFor test case 11: The final array after performing the operations is [7,7,7,7][7,7,7,7]. No other ammo distribution can be done in lesser time.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85sibasish_14\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INAMMO\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ftcf2020, greedy, math, sibasish_14, sibasish_14, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

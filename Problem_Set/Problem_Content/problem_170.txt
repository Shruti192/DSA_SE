b'\nThe Kalakeyas were a powerful, ferocious and cruel clan of Danavas. They were known to be really strong and they did not have any war strategy. They would just attack the enemy randomly and overpower them with sheer number of soldiers. However, we all know that Baahubali and Bhallaladeva defeated the Kalakeyas by following the Thrishul strategy, and successfully defended their kingdom Maahishmati. We also know that Baahubali was very smart, and the truth is that he predicted how the Kalakeyas would attack and  devised a counter strategy for the same, the night before the war. This is what he found:\nThe Kalakeyas had N forts, numbered 1 to N and Baahubali had N soldiers, numbered 1 to N. Baahubali discovered that he can permute his soldiers in any way to get a permutation of 1 to N => P1, P2, ..., PN. He would then send his soldiers to attack the forts in the following way: soldier P1 attacks fort 1, soldier P2 attacks fort 2, ..., soldier PN attacks fort N. It is easy to note that each soldier attacks exactly one fort and no two soldiers attack the same fort. Baahubali also got to know about a secret key of the Kalakeyas, which is an integer K. A soldier X can destroy a fort Y, iff abs(X - Y) >= K. For more details on the abs() function, check here.\n\nYour task is to determine whether Baahubali\'s soldiers can be permuted in some way, such that all forts can be destroyed. In other words, for a permutation P1, P2, ..., PN, Baahubali\'s soldiers can destroy all the forts iff abs(Pi - i) >= K, for all 1 <= i <= N. If this is possible, you are also required to output the lexicographically smallest such permutation. If it is not possible, output -1.\n\nNote: A permutation A1, A2, ..., AN is said to be lexicographically smaller than a permutation B1, B2, ..., BN, if and only if at the first i where Ai and Bi differ, Ai comes before Bi. You can refer here for a more detailed definition of lexicographic ordering.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contain two space separated integers N and K denoting the values mentioned in the statement above.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N space separated integers (which should be a permutation of [1..N], if Baahubali\'s soldiers can break all the forts. If it is not possible to break all the forts, output "-1" (quotes for clarity).\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nThe sum of N over all test cases in a single test file will not exceed 105\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 2\n3 0\n3 1\n\nOutput:\n-1\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n\nExplanation\nFor the first test case, N = 2 and K = 2. It is impossible to permute [1, 2] in any way such that abs(P[1]-1) >= 2 and abs(P[2]-2) >= 2. Hence, output is -1.\nFor the second test case, N = 3 and K = 0. We can just set P[i] = i, and hence the answer is 1 2 3\nFor the third case, the valid permutations are [2, 3, 1] and [3, 1, 2]. The answer is [2, 3, 1] since it is lexicographically smaller than [3, 1, 2].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85suh_ash2008\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AMR15C\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Constructive, Observation, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-10-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

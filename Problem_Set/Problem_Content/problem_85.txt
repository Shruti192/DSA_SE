b"\nYou're given a sequence of NN distinct integers. You need to find a subsequence of length KK with the maximum possible median.\nThe median of a sequence is the value of the element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is selected. For example, if the sequence is [3,4,2,1,5][3,4,2,1,5], then the median is 33 since after sorting, it will look like [1,2,3,4,5][1,2,3,4,5] and 33 is the only middle element. The median of [4,2,1,5][4,2,1,5] is 22 since after sorting, the value 22 is the left of the two middle elements 22 and 44.\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if the sequence is [2,1,4,5,7][2,1,4,5,7], then [1,5,7][1,5,7], [2,1,4][2,1,4], [5][5] are some valid subsequences but [4,1,2][4,1,2], [1,6,7][1,6,7] are not.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain TT, the number of test cases. The description of test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers NN, the length of the sequence, and KK, the length of the subsequence to be found.\nThe second line of each test case consists of NN distinct space-separated integers AiAi, the elements of the sequence.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, output two lines.\nThe first line should consist of the median of the subsequence with the maximum median.\nThe second line should consist of KK space-separated integers, representing a subsequence with that median. If there are multiple such subsequences, print any.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4301\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa430\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x971051\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NN over all test cases won't exceed 5\xc3\x971055\xc3\x97105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 3\n1 4 3 6 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 6 5\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85hitch_hiker42\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SUBMEDIA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sorting, Subsequence\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Groupings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1750\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

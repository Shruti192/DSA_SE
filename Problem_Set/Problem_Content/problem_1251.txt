b'\nChef lives in Chefland. He has a chocolate bar of a length LL. To overcome the competition in Chefland  he thinks that he should have any size of chocolate bar so that he can serve first customer nicely. But he also has to make minimum effort .\nChef wants to cut the Chocolate bar into some pieces in such a way that he can make chocolate bar of every possible length lenlen where 1\xe2\x89\xa4len\xe2\x89\xa4L1\xe2\x89\xa4len\xe2\x89\xa4L by adding already cutted pieces of chocolate bar. \nFor example :\nIf length of Chocolate bar = 3 and pieces are of length 1,2.\nThen chef can make all chocolate bars of length from 1 to 3 using these 2 pieces by following addition :\n\nChef already have chocolate bar of length 1 and 2. \nChef can make chocolate bar of length 3 using addition of 1 and 2 as 3 = 1 + 2\n\nSo now chef has to make some cuts in Chocolate bar to divide it into exactly KK pieces and length of each piece must be a positive an integer. \nAlso making cuts takes effort so chef wants to minimize the value of K.\nChef is  busy in cooking dishes. So he asks for your help.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a number LL, length of chocolate bar.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing number KK minimum number of pieces of Chocolate bar we have to cut.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n2\n6\n4\n\nSample Output:\n3\n3\n\nEXPLANATION:\nTest case 1:\nWe can cut chocolate bar into minimum 3 pieces of length 1,2,3 . Now we have length of 1 ,2,3 pieces of chocolate bar and from this we can form length of 4 chocolate bar by adding pieces 1 and 3. Length of 5 chocolate bar can formed from by adding pieces 2 and 3.Length of 6 chocolate bar can be formed from by adding pieces 1,2,and 3.\nSo that we can make any size of Chocolate bar of 1\xe2\x89\xa4Length\xe2\x89\xa4L1\xe2\x89\xa4Length\xe2\x89\xa4L :- 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 by adding length of 1,2 and 3 pieces.\n(1,2,3,4=3+1,5=3+2,6=1+2+3)(1,2,3,4=3+1,5=3+2,6=1+2+3) \nTest case 2:\nWe can cut chocolate bar into minimum 3 pieces of length 1,1,2 . Now we have length of 1 ,1,2 pieces of chocolate bar and from this we can form length of 3 chocolate bar by adding pieces 1 and 2 .Length of 4 chocolate bar by adding pieces 1 ,1 and 2 .\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85aman_gupta2486\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/D2C103\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aman_gupta2486, cakewalk, d2co2020, logarithm, math, observation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

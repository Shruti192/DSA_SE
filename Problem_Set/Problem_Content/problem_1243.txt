b'\nMotu and Patlu have won a Jackpot of n bags of Samosas. Each bag is tagged with a number from 1 to n and the number of Samosas contained in each bag is equal to the tag number.\n(eg: Bag1 contains 1 Samosa and Bag2 contains 2 Samosas, etc\xe2\x80\xa6)\nMotu and Patlu have decided to divide the bags among themselves such that the total number of Samosas each of them receive is equal.\nSum(M) - Sum(P) = 0\nSum(M): the total number of Samosas in the bags that Motu receives\nSum(P): the total number of Samosas in the bags that Patlu receives\nDetermine if it is possible to divide equally. Note: Samosas should be divided as a whole. (Splitting a Samosa into fractions is not possible)\nInput Format\n\nThe input contains NN, the number of bags of Samosas. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output in a single line \xe2\x80\x9cYES\xe2\x80\x9d if it is possible and \xe2\x80\x9cNO\xe2\x80\x9d if it is not. (Without quotation marks)\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nMotu -> {Bag1, Bag2} (Sum = 3)\nPatlu -> {Bag3} (Sum = 3)\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nIt is impossible to divide the bags among Motu and Patlu such that they receive an equal number of Samosas.\n\n                        Sample Input 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nIt is impossible to divide the bags among Motu and Patlu such that they receive an equal number of Samosas.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85meenaksshi\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85meenaksshi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHAAT3\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, math, meenaksshi\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

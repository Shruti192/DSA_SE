b"\nAbhinav loves electric circuits. Currently he is working on a new circuit for which he requires some connecting wires. He needs to make a total of NN connections and he has mentioned his wire length requirements for each connection in an integer sequence AA. There is an electric store near his house, from where he needs to buy wires. It is a very weird store, because you have to decide most of the things yourself, so it takes a lot of thinking. For instance, for buying wires, you need to decide the length of each wire piece, and you'll get as many wire pieces of the chosen length each at unit cost (cost 11 per piece) but you can't get wires of different lengths. Also, you can't cut wire pieces to make new pieces of different (smaller) length(s). Isn't that weird?\nBut you can connect any number of wires together to form a new single wire piece whose length is the sum of lengths of the wires connected. So, Abhinav needs to choose an integer length for buying wires. Abhinav hates to waste anything, and he hates it even more if that thing is money. So help him decide the length of wires so as to minimize the total expenditure.\nNote: You cannot make a connection which requires a wire piece of length XX with a wire piece of length YY if X\xe2\x89\xa0YX\xe2\x89\xa0Y.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case print a single line containing two space separated integers, length of each wire and the corresponding minimum cost.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109, for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks:\n\n10 points:\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4100, for each valid ii\n90 points: original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n1\n3\n2 4 8\n\nSample Output:\n2 7\n\nExplanation:\nExample Case 1: He needs to make 33 connections of lenghts 22, 44 and 88 respectively. Now he has only two options (in this case) for the length of each piece, which are 11 and 22. If he chooses 11 as the wire length then he will need 1414 pieces of wires and hence spend 1414 units of money. But if he chooses 22 as the wire length, then he will require just 77 pieces, and hence pay only 77 units of money, which is the minimum possible in this case.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ankushkhanna\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DWW19I\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ankushkhanna, ankushkhanna, dwwu2019, easy, greatest-common-divisor, math\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

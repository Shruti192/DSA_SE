b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nAndy and Bob are the only two delivery men of Pizza-chef store. Today, the store received N orders. \nIt's known that the amount of tips may be different when handled by different delivery man. \nMore specifically, if Andy takes the ith order, he would be tipped Ai dollars and if Bob takes this order, \nthe tip would be Bi dollars. \n\n\nThey decided that they would distribute the orders among themselves to maximize the total tip money. One order will be handled by only\none person. Also, due to time constraints Andy cannot take more than X orders and Bob cannot take more than \nY orders. It is guaranteed that X + Y is greater than or equal to N, which means that all the orders can be handled \nby either Andy or Bob.\n\n\nPlease find out the maximum possible amount of total tip money after processing all the orders.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains three integers N, X, Y.\nThe second line contains N integers. The ith integer represents Ai.\nThe third line contains N integers. The ith integer represents Bi.\nOutput\nPrint a single integer representing the maximum tip money they would receive.\nConstraints\nAll test:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X, Y \xe2\x89\xa4 N; X + Y \xe2\x89\xa5 N \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai, Bi \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n\n10 points:\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n\n30 points:\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\n60 points:\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 3 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nExplanation\nBob will take the first three orders (or the first two) and Andy will take the rest (of course).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntuan_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85stzgd\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TADELIVE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1980\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-12-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

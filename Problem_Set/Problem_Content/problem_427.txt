b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nYou are given a string s consisting of upper case Latin alphabets, i.e. from 'A' to 'Z'. Your task is to find how many strings t with length equal to that of S, also consisting of upper case Latin alphabet are there satisfying the following conditions:\n\nString t is lexicographical larger than s\nWhen you write both s and t in the reverse order, t is still lexicographical larger than s.\n\n\n\nFind out number of such strings t. As the answer could be very large, output it modulo 109 + 7\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains string s.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single line containing an integer corresponding to the result in modulo 109 + 7.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\nExample\nInput 1:\nZAZ\n\nOutput 1:\n25\n\nInput 2:\nXYZ\n\nOutput 2:\n5\n\nExplanation\n\nTest #1: To make a valid string t, you can just replace the letter A in S by any other letter, e.g. by replacing 'A' by 'B', we get t = ZBZ. Note that ZBZ is lexicographically larger than ZAZ. Reverse of t (i.e. ZBZ) is also lexicographically larger than reverse of s (i.e. ZAZ).\n\n\nTest #2: there are 5 valid strings: YYZ, ZYZ, XZZ, YZZ, ZZZ\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntuan_adm\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85errichto\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TACNTSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2279\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

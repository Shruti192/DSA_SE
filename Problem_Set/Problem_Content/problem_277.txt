b'\nA scientist is performing an experiment. She has to note down the exact time at which N interesting events occur. Unfortunately, she is very tired and misses some digits while noting down the time. Also, she just forgets about the date. \nSo at the end, there are n timestamp entries in hh:mm:ss format, where hh denotes the hour, mm minutes and ss the seconds. The time is in 24-hour format. Some of the digits are missing and will be denoted by a \'?\'.  The scientist has also forgotten how long back she had started the experiment! So, given these N times, what is the minimum amount of time that has passed since the start of the experiment? \n\n\nThe i-th event always occurs after or at the same time as the (i-1)-th event. The first event always begins at 00:00:00 and that timestamp is correctly noted.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of events.\nThe next N lines each contain strings T1, T2, ..., TN denoting the N timestamps.\nEach timestamp has 8 characters of the form: "hh:mm:ss" (without quotes) denoting the hour (hh), minute (mm) and seconds (ss). Each part maybe prefixed by a 0 to make it fit in the format. Some of the digits in the timestamp may be absent and will be denoted by \'?\'.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of seconds taken for the experiment to be completed.\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 106\nSum of all N over all test cases in a single test file will not exceed 106\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\n5\n00:00:00\n10:10:10\n11:11:11\n23:59:59\n00:00:00\n3\n00:00:00\n23:59:59\n23:59:58\n2\n00:00:00\n2?:??:?1\n3\n00:00:00\n23:59:59\n23:59:?8\n\nOutput:\n86400\n172798\n72001\n172748\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The first event and last event takes place exactly 24 hours apart and all the other event could have occurred between these 2 events. So the minimum amount of time passed is 24 hours (or 24 * 60 * 60 = 86400 seconds) \nExample case 3. Since we have to minimize the amount of time passed, we can fill all ? with 0 and assume the second event occurred at 20:00:01 \n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin3\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 acm16, admin3, greedy, icpc2016, implementation, kgp16\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-12-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

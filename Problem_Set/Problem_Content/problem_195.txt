b'\nAll chefs in the Wolf town are scored by the government and receive the score at the beginning of every year. Now Dark Chef tries to deface his score. The score is shown with the following 7-segment display:\n\nDark Chef can turn on some segments, but he can not turn off any segment. Thus, he can increase his score like as follows:\n\nPlease, note that Dark Chef can add new 7-segment digits to the beginning or the end of his score. But he is not allowed to end up with the score having leading zeros (except when the score is zero itself, see example case 6).\nNow he has received the score S, and he wants to increase his score as much as possible. But the maximum possible score government could give is M. So his score must not exceed M. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible score he could get after defacing.\nNote. The digit "1" can not be changed to the digit "6", because in the representation of the digit "1" we have right 2 segments turned on, while for the digit "6" the upper-right segment must be turned off, see example case 12 for clarity. And, of course, the defaced score must be represented by the digits which have exactly the same form as shown in the above figure.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers S and M, Dark Chef\'s score and the maximum score the government could give respectively.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the maximum possible score Dark Chef could get after defacing.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 2013010 \xe2\x89\xa4 S \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 20130120Each positive integer in the input will be given without leading zerosIf S or M is equal to zero, it will be given in the input as "0" (quotes for clarity)\nExample\nInput:\n12\n25 100\n77 100\n0 100\n8 13\n8 24\n0 0\n19 38\n89375 9247529\n804276 2857282\n0 20130120\n3284709 20130120\n1 6\n\nOutput:\n89\n100\n100\n8\n18\n0\n38\n9189999\n2809898\n20130120\n19889989\n4\n\nExplanation\nThe first three example cases correspond to the figure in the problem statement.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DEFACING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2449\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-01-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.013 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

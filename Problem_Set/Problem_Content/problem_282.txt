b'\n\xc2\xa0\nAsif is participating in a Tv game show \xe2\x80\x9chojoborolo\xe2\x80\x9d ( \xe0\xa6\xb9\xe0\xa6\xaf\xe0\xa6\xac\xe0\xa6\xb0\xe0\xa6\xb2 ) \xe0\xa5\xa4  Where as a winner of every show participate can take money as many as they want but there is a simple restriction to do so .  In the end part of the show ,  the presenter writes a number of N digits in a board. The participant must then erase exactly M digits from the number in the board; the number formed by the remaining digits is the value of the money prize for the participant. As a very good programmer Asif is obvious going to take the highest value from it . Can you tell the highest value of prize Asif is going to take . \n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer T i.e. the number of Test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case has 2 lines. The first line contains N( number of digits the presenter writes in the black board ) and  M (the number of digits that must be erased.).The second line contains n digits of number and the number doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start with zero .\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a line \xe2\x80\x9cCase x: y\xe2\x80\x9d where x is replaced by the test case number and y is  the highest prize Asif  can win.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <=  100\n1 <=  N  <=  1000 \n1 <=  M  <=  N - 1 \n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3 1\n591 \n6 3\n123123\n\n\n\nOutput: \n\nCase 1: 91\nCase 2: 323\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shakilaust\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AUASIF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aust2016, greedy, shakilaust\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-01-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

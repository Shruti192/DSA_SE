b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChef has a random permutation P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN and an integer KK.\nA subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) of this permutation is called good if it has at most KK pairs of neighbouring elements such that the left element is larger than the right element.\nChef wants to know the maximum length of a good subsequence of his permutation. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum length of a good subsequence.\nConstraints\n\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa450,0000\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa450,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\nthe permutation is chosen uniformly randomly among all permutations of the integers 11 through NN; note that KK is not independent from the chosen permutation (it can be chosen differently depending on the permutation)\n\nExample Input\n8 1\n2 7 6 3 4 1 8 5\n\nExample Output\n5\n\nExplanation\nOne good subsequence with the maximum length is [2,3,4,1,5][2,3,4,1,5].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85karpovich\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GRAND\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Randomized Algorithms, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3432\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-06-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

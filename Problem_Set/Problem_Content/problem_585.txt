b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\nDevus are creatures living in Devupur. There are total n Devus in Devupur. ith Devu live in ith house. Houses 1, 2, 3, , ,  n are placed in a single lane i.e. 1 is a neighbor of 2,  2 is a neighbor of 1 and 3 etc.\n\n\nThey decide their president by a very weird voting system. All the Devus contest in the presidential elections. Each person uniformly randomly votes any of the n person as his preference (he can vote himself too). Devus are really very envious creatures, so no Devu casts his vote to the person whom his neighbor has casted. Devus vote in the increasing order of their IDs.\n\n\nFinally all the votes are counted and all the Devus having votes equal to highest voted Devu are selected as president.\n\n\nNow you are interested in finding out expected number of presidents Devupur can select in their upcoming election. Please round the answer to 6 digits after decimal.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases.\nFor each test case, there is a single line containing a single integer n.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single real number corresponding to the answer of the problem.\n\nConstraints and Subtasks\nSubtask 1 (15 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, n \xe2\x89\xa4 7\n\nSubtask 2 (25 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, n \xe2\x89\xa4 18\n \nSubtask 3 (60 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, n \xe2\x89\xa4 36\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1.000000\n2.000000\n\n\nExplanation\n\nExample 1:\n1st Devu votes himself and get elected for president. So expected number of presidents are 1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\tBoth the Devus cast their vote to themselves. So total number of presidents selected are 2.\n\tDevu 1 votes to Devu 2 and Devu 2 votes to Devu 1. In this way, again total total number of presidents selected are 2.\n\tSo expected number of presidents selected are (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DEVVOTE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Probability, Partitions, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Combinatorics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2668\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-03-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

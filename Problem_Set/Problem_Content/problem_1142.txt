b"\nYou are given a tree with nn vertices numbered 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n. There are two players Alice and Bob who play a game on this tree, taking turns alternatively.  Alice starts.\nIn their turn a participant has to remove a leaf (and the edge adjacent to it) from the tree. A leaf is a node with degree 11. Please note, that the tree changes with the game progressing, and a node which is not a leaf in the beginning can become a leaf later and become eligible to be removed.\nAlice likes the vertex xx and wants it be the last node remaining. Bob hates node xx and doesn't want it to be the last node remaining.\nFor all the choices of vertex xx, find who wins assuming both play optimally.\nInput\nThere are multiple independent testcases.\n\nThe first line contains TT, the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single interger nn, the number of vertices.\nEach of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers denoting the endpoints of an edge. Each edge is present only once.\n\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print a string of length nn on a new line. The ithith character in this string should be 11 if Alice wins the game for x=ix=i, and 00 if Bob wins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe sum of nn over all testcases doesn't exceed 105105.\n\nExample Input\n2\n2\n1 2\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n\nExample Output\n11\n00000\n\nExplanation\nIn the first testcase. If x=1x=1, Alice removes node 22 and wins. If x=2x=2, Alice removes node 11 and wins.\nIn the second testcase, consider x=1x=1. If Alice removes node 22, Bob can remove node 11 in his turn and win. If Alice removes node 44, Bob then removes node 22. Then in her turn, Alice can only remove node 55 leaving two nodes 11 and 33. Bob can now remove node 11 and win. The game proceeds similarly if Alice removes node 55 first. So, Bob wins the game.\nOne can see that for other choices of xx as well, Bob wins.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85jtnydv25\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Mathematics, DFS, Game Theory\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

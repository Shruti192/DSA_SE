b'\nYou are given a MM x MM grid representing a city. A cell in this grid is represented as (i,j)(i,j), i.e. the cell at the ii-th row and jj-th column in the grid. You own two trucks AA and BB that deliver goods. Truck AA is located at at (Ax,Ay)(Ax,Ay) and Truck BB is located at (Bx,By)(Bx,By). Both trucks have an infinite number of goods. The two trucks could initially be at the same location.\nThe distance to travel between cells (i1,j1)(i1,j1) and (i2,j2)(i2,j2) is the Manhattan Distance, i.e.,  |i1\xe2\x88\x92i2|+|j1\xe2\x88\x92j2||i1\xe2\x88\x92i2|+|j1\xe2\x88\x92j2| units.\nYour company has to serve NN orders, where the ii-th order is located at position (xi,yi)(xi,yi). An order is said to be served if some truck moves to the location of the ii-th order. Additionally, the ii-th order can be served only once all order numbers from 1 to i\xe2\x88\x921i\xe2\x88\x921 have been served.\nWhat is the minimum total distance that the trucks must travel to serve all NN orders?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NN, the number of orders to serve.\nThe next line contains 2 space separated integers, Ax,AyAx,Ay, the co-ordinates of truck A\nThe next line contains 2 space separated integers, Bx,ByBx,By, the co-ordinates of truck B\nNN lines lines follow, ii-th of which contains 2 space separated integers, (xi,yi)(xi,yi), the location of the ii-th order.\n\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer, denoting the minimum total distance travelled by the trucks.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By,xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By,xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100 and 1\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By,xi,yi,\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By,xi,yi,\xe2\x89\xa4100\n70 points : original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n3\n3 2\n4 2\n2 1\n2 4\n2 1  \nSample Output:\n6\nEXPLANATION:\nTruck A serves orders 1 and 3 while truck B serves order number 2. Total distance covered by A is 2 units and by B is 4 units. The total distance covered by both trucks combined is 6 units and this is optimal.\nOne should keep in mind that order number 3 is not served instantly when truck A arrives at location (2,1)(2,1). Instead it is served only after both orders 1 and 2 have been served.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85vastolorde95\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DOBDELIV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy-medium, locapr18, vastolorde95\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2548\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-04-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

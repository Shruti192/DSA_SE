b'\nChefu\'s exams are going on. Due to the pandemic, his school is still closed and all exams are being conducted online. Chefu and his friends have made an group on Signal app to discuss the questions during the exams, taking most of the benefit of this online exams system. Chefu is one of those students who attends all the classes and is every teachers\' favorite. Today is Maths exam of Chefu and teacher gave him a hint that "Learn how to find SquareSquare RootRoot of a number ". At the starting of the exam he shared the hint with his friends. All of them are pretty confidant to score good marks as questions related to only square root will be asked.  \nExam started. Teacher gave them a positive integer AA and asked them to find two integers BB and CC , and return the minimum sum B+CB+C . The conditions to choose B and C are :   \n\nthe product of BB and CC is strictly greater than AA. Formally, B\xe2\x88\x97C>AB\xe2\x88\x97C>A , and  \nB and C need not to be distinct, they can be same alsoalso.   \nsum (B+C)(B+C) is minimum possible. This sum is the answer . \n\nChefu and his friends know that they need to do something with the SquareSquare RootRoot of the given number AA, but don\'t know what to do next. Can you help them with the further steps and find the answer for them ?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer AA. \n\nOutput:\nPrint one integer, the minimum sum B+CB+C .\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n4\n7\n8\n19\n16    \nSample Output:\n6\n6\n9\n9  \nEXPLANATION:\nCase\xc2\xa0#1Case\xc2\xa0#1 : possible B and C can be 3,3. Sum is 6. B and C can be also 2,4. But minimum sum B+C is 6 only. You cannot find any other values of B or C such that sum is less than 6 and product is greater than 7.\nCase\xc2\xa0#2Case\xc2\xa0#2 : in this case also B and C can be 3,3. This will give minimum sum 6.  \nCase\xc2\xa0#3Case\xc2\xa0#3 : Two numbers whose product is greater than 19 and sum is minimum is 4,5. \nCase\xc2\xa0#4Case\xc2\xa0#4 : here B and C can be 4,5. This will give minimum sum 9. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85prasoonjain006\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MATHEXM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, heat2021, math, observation, prasoonjain006\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

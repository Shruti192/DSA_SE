However, he knows that he can only become a successful coder if he works hard. Fortunately, he has a problem in mind for training.\nYou are given two positive integers aa and bb. You may apply the following magical operation any number of times (including zero):\n\nchoose an arbitrary positive integer dd\nperform exactly one of the following actions:\nadd dd to aa, add d\xe2\x88\x921d\xe2\x88\x921 to bb\nadd d\xe2\x88\x921d\xe2\x88\x921 to aa, add dd to bb\n\nChef is asking you to find out if it is possible to obtain a=ba=b. Help him!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers aa and bb. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to obtain a=ba=b or "NO" if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtaks #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One possible strategy for Chef is:\n\nchoose d=10d=10, add d\xe2\x88\x921=9d\xe2\x88\x921=9 to aa and d=10d=10 to bb; after this operation, a=14a=14 and b=17b=17\nchoose d=10d=10, add d=10d=10 to aa and d\xe2\x88\x921=9d\xe2\x88\x921=9 to bb; afterwards, a=24a=24 and b=26b=26\nchoose d=9d=9, add d=9d=9 to aa and d\xe2\x88\x921=8d\xe2\x88\x921=8 to bb; afterwards, a=33a=33 and b=34b=34\nchoose d=9d=9, add dd to aa and d\xe2\x88\x921d\xe2\x88\x921 to bb; finally, we have a=b=42a=b=42\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFTIRED\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1130\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

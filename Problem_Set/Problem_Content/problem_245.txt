b"\n\nChef has decided to take a break, and go for a ride. He is currently in city 0, and he wants to get to city N.\nThe cities along the road from 0 to N are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, ... N-1, N in increasing order of distance from city 0.\nThe distance between cities i and i-1 is denoted by di.\n\nHowever, as is always the case, it is unsafe to travel at night, so he will have to break his journey over multiple days.\nChef may travel at most D distance in any day, so he will have to book hotel for overnight stay in some of the cities.\nOn any day, Chef will begin his journey from some city and end his journey at some other city.\nChef wants to reach city N in as few days as possible, so he has to plan his trip accordingly.\nLet L be the minimum number of days in which he can reach city N.\n\nChef knows the cost of overnight stay in each city. The cost of overnight stay in city i is ci.\nChef will need to get all his hotel bills re-embersed, and his boss might get suspicious if cost for any single day exceeds a threshold.\n\nChef knows that his boss wants him to reach as soon as possible. Thus, if it is possible for Chef to go from 0 to N in L days with no restriction on where Chef stays, then his boss will want him to reach in exactly L days. However, if the boss puts a threshold value i then we know that the Chef may not be able to reach in L days (since he may not be allowed to stay at some hotels). Help him him find the minimum threshold value C such that if he only stays in hotels of cost <= C, it is possible for him to reach the destination N in exactly L days (remember, here L is the minimum number of days needed by Chef if there were absolutely no restrictions on where he stays).\n\nFormally, let L be the minimal number of days it takes Chef to get from city 0 to city N. Let F(i) be the minimal number of days it takes Chef to get from city 0 to city N if it's not allowed to pay more than i for a single stay in hotel. Find the smallest C that will still allow Chef to get to city N without losing time. In other words F(C)=L. Find and output L as well.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case has two space separated integers N and D.\nN lines follow, each having two space separated integers, di and ci.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a separate line containing the values of L and C.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 15 \n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 D \xe2\x89\xa4 109 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 di \xe2\x89\xa4 D\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ci \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nThe sum of N over all test cases in any file is at most 4*105.\n\n\nSubtack 1 (30 points)\nN \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n\nSubtack 2 (30 points)\ndi = 1, D = 9\n\nSubtask 3 (40 points): \n No special constraints \n\n\nExample:\nSample Input\n2\n4 5\n2 4\n1 2\n3 3\n1 1\n5 6\n2 1\n4 4\n2 2\n2 3\n4 5\nSample output\n2 2\n3 2\nExplanation\nFor test case# 1, the optimal trip is 0 \xe2\x86\x92 2 \xe2\x86\x92 4\nFor test case# 2, the optimal trip is 0 \xe2\x86\x92 1 \xe2\x86\x92 3 \xe2\x86\x92 5\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85utkarsh_lath\n\n\nTester:\n\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRIPCOST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Binary Search on Answer\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Searching, Binary Search\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2292\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-07-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

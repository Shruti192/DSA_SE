b'\n Read problems statements in Russian here\nPolo, the Penguin, has a lot of tests tomorrow at the university.\nHe knows that there are N different questions that will be on the tests. For each question i (i = 1..N), he knows C[i] - the number of tests that will contain this question, P[i] - the number of points that he will get for correctly answering this question on each of tests and T[i] - the amount of time (in minutes) that he needs to spend to learn this question.\nUnfortunately, the amount of free time that Polo has is limited to W minutes. Help him to find the maximal possible total number of points he can get for all tests if he studies for no more than W minutes.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains the pair of integers N and W, separated by a space. The following N lines contain three space-separated integers C[i], P[i] and T[i] (i = 1..N).\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 C[i], P[i], T[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 W \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 7\n1 2 3\n2 3 5\n3 3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The best choice is to learn the first and the third questions and get 1*2 + 3*3 = 11 points.\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85rustinpiece\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PPTEST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 0-1 Knapsack\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Knapsack\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1603\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-09-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

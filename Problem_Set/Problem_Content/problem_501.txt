b"\n Read problems statements in Russian here\nThe Head Chef is interested in studying interactions between his chefs . There are  N  chefs with ids 1 to N . Each chef trusts some of the other chefs . The relation of trust is one way . Also , a chef may trust chefs only with ids strictly greater than his/her id .A chef with id = i , trusts the chefs with next ni id's.  \nThe Head Chef wants to know given a chef B and a set of chefs S,  how many lines of trust exist between each element of S and B . A line of trust between chefs A and B is a sequence of chefs a1 ... ak starting at A ( a1 = A )and finishing at B  (Ak = B) such that Ai trusts A(i+1)  for all i ( 1 to k-1) . Two lines of trust are different if they have a different chef at the some position in the line . \n\nSince the answer may be quite large , output it modulo 1000000007 .\nInput\nThe first line contains a two space seperated integers N and  B denoting the number of chefs and the target chef for whom the lines of trust have to be calculated.  \nThe next  N lines contains an integer  ni denoting the number of chefs which are trusted by the chef with id = i .  \n The next line contains a single integer  Q  denoting the number of queries \n The next  Q  lines contain elements of set S .\nOutput\nOutput a single line for each query containing the answer to the query.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 200000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 B \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Each element of set S  < B\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i + ni ( for i = 1 to N )  \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 ni ( for i = 1 to N )  \xe2\x89\xa4 N - 1\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 3\n2\n1\n0\n2\n1\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

Let\'s call such a sequence of pairs a pairing.\nFor a pairing (A1,B1),(A2,B2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(AN,BN)(A1,B1),(A2,B2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(AN,BN), we can create an undirected graph with 2N2N nodes (numbered 11 through 2N2N) and the following edges:\n\nfirst type: for each valid ii, an edge between nodes ii and i+1i+1\nsecond type: for each valid ii, an edge between nodes AiAi and BiBi\n\nThis pairing is valid if for each edge (i,i+1)(i,i+1) of the first type, there is an edge of the second type (Aj,Bj)(Aj,Bj) which "surrounds" it, i.e. satisfies Aj\xe2\x89\xa4iAj\xe2\x89\xa4i and Bj>iBj>i. The cost of a valid pairing is defined as the number of pairs of edges of the second type such that one of these edges is "nested" in the other, i.e. pairs (Ai,Bi)(Ai,Bi) and (Aj,Bj)(Aj,Bj) such that Ai<Aj<Bj<BiAi<Aj<Bj<Bi.\nFind the sum of costs of all valid pairings. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo a given prime PP.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and PP.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the sum of costs of all valid pairings modulo PP.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41021\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4102\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41032\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4109\nPP is prime\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 10,00010,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): N\xe2\x89\xa410N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 17\n3 5\n817 999999797\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n223160771\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: For N=2N=2, there are two valid pairings [(1,3),(2,4)][(1,3),(2,4)] and [(1,4),(2,3)][(1,4),(2,3)], with costs 00 and 11 respectively.\nExample case 2: For N=3N=3, all valid pairings along with their costs are listed below. \n\n[(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)][(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)] with cost 00\n[(1,4),(2,6),(3,5)][(1,4),(2,6),(3,5)] with cost 11\n[(1,5),(2,4),(3,6)][(1,5),(2,4),(3,6)] with cost 11\n[(1,5),(2,6),(3,4)][(1,5),(2,6),(3,4)] with cost 22\n[(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)][(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)] with cost 33\n[(1,6),(2,4),(3,5)][(1,6),(2,4),(3,5)] with cost 22\n[(1,3),(2,6),(4,5)][(1,3),(2,6),(4,5)] with cost 11\n[(1,3),(2,5),(4,6)][(1,3),(2,5),(4,6)] with cost 00\n[(1,6),(2,3),(4,5)][(1,6),(2,3),(4,5)] with cost 22\n[(1,5),(2,3),(4,6)][(1,5),(2,3),(4,6)] with cost 11\n\nThe sum of all costs is 1313 and its remainder modulo 55 is 33.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85shashwatchandr\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/POFP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bit Manipulation, Dynamic Programming, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2926\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-07-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nProbably everyone has experienced an awkward situation due to shared armrests between seats in cinemas. A highly accomplished cinema manager named "Chef" decided to solve this problem.\n\n\nWhen a customer wants to buy a ticket, the clerk at the ticket window asks the visitor if they need the armrests, and if so, which of them: left, right, or both. We know that out of the audience expected to show up, L of them only need the left armrest, R of them need just the right one, Z need none and B need both. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of people that can attend the show. In the cinema hall there are N rows with M seats each. There is only one armrest between two adjacent seats. Seats at the beginning and at the end of the row have two armrests\n\nInput\n\nInput begins with an integer T: the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a single line with 6 space-separated integers: N, M, Z, L, R, B.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing the answer for the task.\n\nConstraints and Subtasks\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n\nSubtask 1 : 10 points \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 3 \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Z, L, R, B \xe2\x89\xa4 3 \n\nSubtask 2 : 20 points \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 30 \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Z, L, R \xe2\x89\xa4 30 \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 B \xe2\x89\xa4 109 \n\nSubtask 3 : 30 points\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 106 \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Z, L, R \xe2\x89\xa4 106 \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 B \xe2\x89\xa4 1016 \n\nSubtask 4 : 40 points\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 108 \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Z, L, R, B \xe2\x89\xa4 1016 \n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2 2 3 2 1 1\n3 3 1 2 0 9\n\nOutput:\n4\n8\n\nExplanation\n\'L\' - needs left\n\'R - needs right\n\'Z\' - doesn\'t need any\n\'B\' - needs both\n\'-\' - empty place\n\nExample case 1.\nZZ\nZB\nExample case 2.\nLLB\nBZB\nB-B\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85omelyanenko\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHCINEMA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Inequalities, Greedy, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algebra, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2327\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-07-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

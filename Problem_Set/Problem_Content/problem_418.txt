b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nA meteor fell on Andrew's house. That's why he decided to build a new home and chose a site where he wanted to build it. Let the whole area be a rectangular field of size NxM. Naturally, Andrew wanted to build a house on the entire area of the site. However, the Hazardous Construction Prevention Bureau did not let Andrew's plans come true. The Bureau said that some of the cells of the field are dangerous for the foundation. There are exactly K such cells. \nAndrew's not a poor man. And as anyone who has money, he saves money. Therefore, he is willing to buy not the whole area, but only a stripe of the same width. The house will occupy a rectangular area in this stripe with sides parallel to the sides of the original site.\nAndrew is asking for your help: for each Li, Hi  - the lowest and the highest boundaries (inclusive), respectively - find the maximum area of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe house that Andrew can build on the relevant site.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nIn the first line you are given three integers N, M and K.\nIn the following K lines you are given different pairs of integers xi, yi - the coordinates of the dangerous cells.\nNext line contains an integer Q - the number of Andrew's queries\nThe last Q lines describe the queries: each line contains two integers L and H - the lowest and the highest boundaries.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nIn the output file, print Q lines, where i-th line contains the answer for i-th query. If you cannot build the house, then output 0.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N * M\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 xi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 yi \xe2\x89\xa4 M\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Li \xe2\x89\xa4  Hi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n4 5 5\n2 1\n3 2\n1 3\n2 4\n1 4\n4\n1 1\n3 4\n2 3\n1 4\n\nOutput:\n2\n6\n3\n6\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nroman_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85white_king\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/METEORAK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Monotonic stack, DP Approach\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Stacks, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2233\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-11-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

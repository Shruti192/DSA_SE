b'\nSome like to collect coins, some caps, some stickers. But Tom likes to collect cut-outs of words from the newspaper. The most weird fact is that he decides a word WW for a newspaper and cuts out its occurrences from that newspaper. But he is lazy, he skims through the newspaper and whenever he finds an occurrence of WW in the newspaper, he cuts it out. In this process he might skip some occurrences. Also, some occurrences might overlap, for example in ababaababa, the occurrences of abaaba is overlapping. So, if Tom cuts out one of the occurrences, the other no longer exists.\nGiven a newspaper as a string NN (containing only lowercase English letters) [very weird newspaper indeed!] and a word WW (also containing only lowercase English letters), find the total number of ways in which Tom can cut out at least one occurrence of WW in NN. (See sample input for better understanding).\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains a single integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains the string NN.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string WW.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the total number of ways in which Tom can cut out at least one occurrence of WW in NN. As this answer can be large, output the answer modulo 10000000071000000007. (See sample input and explanation for better understanding).\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|W|\xe2\x89\xa4|N|\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x971051\xe2\x89\xa4|W|\xe2\x89\xa4|N|\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x97105\nWW and NN contain only lowercase English letters\n\nSample Input:\n3\ncabc\nab\ncabc\nc\nababa\naba\n\nSample Output:\n1\n3\n2\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the first test case, there is only one occurrence of abab in cabccabc. Hence, no. of ways of cutting out at least one occurrence of abab is 11.\nIn the second test case, cc occurs twice. Hence, no. of ways of cutting out at least one occurrence of cc is 33 (just the first, just the second, and cutting both first and second).\nIn the third test case, abaaba occurs twice, but they are overlapping. So, if the first occurrence is cut out, the second occurrence no longer exists. Hence, no. of ways of cutting out at least one occurrence of abaaba is 22 (just the first occurrence and just the second occurrence).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85kishen1912000\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COLWORD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cnvx2020, dynamic-programming, kishen1912000, knuth-morris-pratt-algorithm, medium, z-algorithm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-09-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

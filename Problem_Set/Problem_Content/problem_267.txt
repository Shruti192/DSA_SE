b"\n\xc2\xa0\n\nFlippy the bird has a permutation p of length n while Fluffy the squirrel has a permutation q of length n. Flippy the bird wants his permutation to be the same as Fluffy's permutation. He can cut the permutation into several parts, and rearrange those parts so that the resulting permutation is equal to q. He wants to cut the permutation into the minimum possible number of pieces. Can you help him determine the minimum number of pieces he needs to cut the permutation into?\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer n, the length of the sequence. The next line contains n space-seperated integers, p1, p2, ..., pn. It is guaranteed that these numbers are a permutation of 1, 2, ..., n. The next line contains n space-seperated integers, q1, q2, ..., qn. It is guaranteed that these numbers are a permutation of 1, 2, ..., n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOutput a single integer, the minimum number of pieces that Flippy needs to cut to form Fluffy's permutation. (Note that if Flippy doesn't cut, the number of pieces is 1)\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 300000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (45 points) : qi = i for all i\nSubtask 2 (55 points) : Original Constraints\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n5\n3 2 1 4 5\n2 3 1 4 5\nOutput:\n3\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case. One can cut the permutation p into 3 parts, [3], [2], [1, 4, 5], and then rearrange it into [2], [3], [1, 4, 5], which is the permutation q.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85zscoder\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MCO16401\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, greedy, zscoder\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-11-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n - 1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

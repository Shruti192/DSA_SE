b"\nSemCrack is hosting a campus drive for emerging programmers, there are N number of programmers who  attended the drive and their skills are as follows S[0], S[1].....S[N-1] (assume 0 based indexing). Company has it's set of protocols to select the programmer which are as follows:\n\nCampus has set a condition that a programmer can only be selected, if his/her skills are strictly greater than K, which is defined by company.\n\nThere are Q number of queries that need to be executed. These queries may be of following two types:\n\n1 X Y (0 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4 N-1) - Replace the value of Xth array element by Y. \n2 L R (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 N-1) - Return the number of selected programmers in this range.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two space separated positive integers N and K denoting the total number of programmers and K condition which is defined by company.Next line contains the skills of programmers S[0], S[1]......S[N-1].Next line contains an integer Q number of queries.\nEach of the next Q lines contains one of the two queries described above.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each query of type 2, print the required answer in a new line.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 S[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 108\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4 N-1\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Y, K \xe2\x89\xa4 108\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 L  \xe2\x89\xa4  R  \xe2\x89\xa4 N-1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points):\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\nExample\nInput:\n10 3\n2 4 7 6 7 2 4 2 5 1\n5\n2 0 3\n1 4 7\n1 6 7\n2 1 1\n1 5 8\n\nOutput:\n3\n1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nFirst you have an array S = {2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1}\nQuery 1.\nNumber of selected programmers in range [0, 3]\nThere are three programmer having skills greater then K\n2, 4, 7So answer is 3.\nQuery 2.\nReplace value of 4th  element with 7.\nS = {2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1}\nQuery 3.\nReplace value of 6th  element with 7.\nS = {2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 2, 4, 7, 5, 1}\nQuery 4.\nNumber of selected programmers in range [1, 1]\nThere is only one programmer having skills greater then K\n4So answer is 1.\nQuery 5.\nReplace value of 5th  element with 8.\nS = {2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 2, 4, 7, 8, 1}\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85chhekur\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CPC4\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 chhekur, codh2018, dynamic-programming, easy, segment-tree, sqrt, square-root-decomposition\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.7 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

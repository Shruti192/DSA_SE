b'\n\nThe University management meets every semester to discuss about the issues of the University in a round table conference. Therefore new proposals are made to the present academic curriculum. However whenever a new proposal comes from a member, all the members of the round table, except the adjacent members , throws his/her question for that proposal. It is known that every member has a proposal. Given the total no. of members in a round table meeting, you have to answer the total no. of questions thrown across the table on that particular day. Since the answer may be large, you have to print it in modulo 109+7.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases.\nNext line contains an integer n, the number of members who were present on that day.\n\nOutput\nPrint the answer in a new line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n291\n\nOutput:\n41904\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85deathcoder007\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/UNIVMT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, cost2016, deathcoder007, easy, math, modulo, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, JS\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nThere are nn athletes in a row numbered 11 to nn from left to right waiting to receive medals from Mr chef for their outstanding performance. Each one of the athletes is either facing left or right. When an athlete receives the medal, all the other athletes that can see the current athlete, increase their respect for Mr chef by  11. An athlete that faces left sees all the athletes with lower indices than his index irrespective of the direction they face, and an athlete facing right sees all the athletes with higher indices than his index irrespective of the direction they face.\nAn athlete who has received the medal becomes uninterested and will not gain any respect for Mr chef after receiving the medal.\nMr chef can present medals to the athletes in any order. All the athletes will receive the medal once.  \nNote: An athlete can gain respect for Mr chef multiple times.  \nFind out the difference between the maximum possible sum of respect that can be gained and the minimum possible sum of respect that can be gained for Mr chef.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TT, the number of test cases.

b"\n Read problems statements in Russian here\nLucy is taking math analysis classes in her school. She always has a lot of homework and she always spends a considerable amount of time in order to do it, but today she had completely forgotten about it for some reason. So, please, help her!\nLucy asks you to solve to following problem: calculate the following:  Output the result till the D-th digit after the decimal point. We're asking you to output truncated result, but not rounded!\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test is described by a line of four numbers - a, p, q and D respectively. a, p, q will be given with exactly two digits after the decimal point.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case (with D digits after the decimal point).\nExample\nInput:\n3\n0.62 2.71 3.14 42\n0.91 4.70 6.67 18\n0.01 9.81 8.63 66\n\nOutput:\n17.903573407202216066481994459833795013850415\n796.867901234567901234\n0.187143148658300173451688603203754718906234057749209264360779512294\n\nScoring\nIn all the test cases, 0.01 <= a < 1.00, 0.00 <= p <= 10.00, 0.00 <= q <= 10.00\nOutput will not exceed 1 MB\nSubtask 1 (31 point): T = 100000, 5 <= D <= 7, 0.01 <= a <= 0.50\nSubtask 2 (29 points): T = 100, 50 <= D <= 100\nSubtask 3 (15 points): T = 10000, 50 <= D <= 100\nSubtask 4 (25 points): 10 <= T <= 100, 1 <= D <= 100000\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LMA1\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arbitrary Precision, Basic Maths, Fractions\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2366\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-10-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\n\nLanku lives in a mysterious country having N cities. In his country instead of one capital, any number of cities can be capital. There are many cities in his country, but only the capital cities have all the facilities like hospitals, markets etc.\nSo in order to get anything you have to visit the capital city.\nIn order to simplify it, every city has been assigned to exactly one capital city. \nApart from this, every capital city has an entry fee which means that whenever a person from another city enters its assigned capital city, he has to pay some entry fee.\n Consider one unit cost is used to travel one unit distance. \n \nYou will be given the location of  N cities as N integers   x1 , x2\n , x3 .... , xN. \nYou will also be provided with a positive integer K \n\nNow your objective is to choose  exactly K cities as capital and assign every city to exactly one capital city such that following function F is minimized: \nC[1] = cost to travel from 1st city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital. \nC[2] = cost to travel from 2nd city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital.  \n..... \n..... \nC[N] = cost to travel from Nth city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital.  \nF = C[1] + C[2] + .... C[N]  \nNOTE: If the ith city is capital city then C[i] = 0.\n\nOutput the minimum possible value of the function F. \n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\n\nFirst line of input will contain number of test cases T.\n\n\nFirst line of each test case will contain 2 integers N and K\n\n\nSecond line of each test case will contain N integers which are the positions of cities in  1-Dimensional co-ordinate system.\n\n\nThird line of each test case will contain N  integers which are the entry fee of the ith city.\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\n\nOutput will contain T lines, one for each test case.\n\n\nEach line will contain one Integer which is the minimum possible value of the function F.\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 35\n\n\nK \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Entry fee, Position of cities \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput\n1\n7 3\n9 50 20 39 25 41 10\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n\nOutput:\n31\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nIn this scenario minimum possible value of F can be obtained by:\nWe will make city 1, 3, 4 as the capitals. \nCapital at city 1 will be assigned to city 1 and 7.\nCapital at city 3 will be assigned to city 3 and 5.\nCapital at city 4 will be assigned to city 2, 4 and 6.\nC[1] = 0\nC[2] = 11 + 4 = 15\nC[3] = 0\nC[4] = 0\nC[5] = 5 + 3 = 8\nC[6] = 2 + 4 = 6\nC[7] = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85amanmittal\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INSQ15_B\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 amanmittal, dynamic-programming, insq2015, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-09-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

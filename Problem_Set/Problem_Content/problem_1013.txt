b"\nChef considers a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets beautiful if all the characters of the string are vowels. \nChef has a string SS consisting of lowercase English alphabets, of length NN. He wants to convert SS into a beautiful string TT. In order to do so, Chef does the following operation on every character of the string:\n\nIf the character is a consonant, change the character to its closest vowel. \nIf the character is a vowel, don't change it. \n\nChef realizes that the final string TT is not unique. Chef wonders, what is the total number of distinct beautiful strings TT that can be obtained by performing the given operations on the string SS.\nSince the answer can be huge, print it modulo 109+7109+7.\nNote:\n\nThere are 2626 characters in the English alphabet. Five of these characters are vowels: a, e, i, o, and u. The remaining 2121 characters are consonants.\nThe closest vowel to a consonant is the vowel that is least distant from that consonant. For example, the distance between the characters d and e is 11 while the distance between the characters d and a is 33.\nThe distance between the characters z and a is 2525 and not 11.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer TT \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN, denoting the length of the string SS.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string SS consisting of lowercase English alphabets.  \n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the total number of distinct beautiful strings TT that can be obtained by performing the given operations on the string SS, modulo 109+7109+7. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105. \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n5\naeiou\n5\nabcde\n8\nstarters\n8\ncodechef\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n4\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: All the characters of the string SS are vowels. Thus, none of the characters would be changed. The resulting string TT will be aeiou.  \nTest case 22:There are 22 possible strings that can be obtained by performing the given operations on the string SS. Those are aaaee and aaeee. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\nlavish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLOSEVOWEL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Mathematics\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1241\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-05-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

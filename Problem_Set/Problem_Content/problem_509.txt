b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nOne day, you decided to write a message to your girl friend consisting of N uppercase English letters.\nYour girlfriend\'s alphabet is limited to only two letters: \'A\' and \'B\'. She recognizes only the words that are of length M containing letters from her alphabet.\n\nThere are some words that your girlfriend hates. You are given two strings X and Y, which represent some two words she recognizes. Your girlfriend hates words X, Y and also each word that she recognizes and is lexicographically greater than X and smaller than Y .\n\nFor example, if M = 3, X = "ABA" and Y = "BBA" then all words the girlfriend hates are: "ABA", "ABB", "BAA", "BAB" and "BBA". Note that she doesn\'t hate words "AAA", "BB", "AC" or "BCAD". \nThe message that you will send to the girlfriend should not contain any of words she hates as a substring. Note that the message can contain letters the girl doesn\'t recognize. The message will contain N uppercase English letters. Find the number of different messages you can send. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo (109 + 7).\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N and M.\nThe second line contains the string X and the third line contains the string Y, both of length M.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case, modulo (109 + 7).\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 19\nX and Y will consist only of letters \'A\' and \'B\'.\nX will not be lexicographically greater than Y.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1 1\nA\nB\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Out of all 26 possible messages in this case only two are invalid (i.e. "A" and "B"). Thus, the answer is 26 - 2 = 24.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STRAB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Recursion\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2501\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-03-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

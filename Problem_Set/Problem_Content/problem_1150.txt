b'\nMurphy is on an investigation of the quantum data based on the values obtained from the black hole. She is now trying to finish her analysis and reconcile the gravity equation with quantum mechanics. In her last step she now needs to analyse systems with multiple objects at large distances.\nTo explain in detail, she is given a number NN. She needs to find a maximal cardinal set of lattice points lying within the region enclosed by 0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N, 0\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4N such that the Manhattan distance between any two of them is at least NN.\nA lattice point is a point whose integers are both coordinates.\nA Manhattan distance is the sum of absolute differences of each coordinate. Formally, the Manhattan distance between two points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) is |x1\xe2\x88\x92x2|+|y1\xe2\x88\x92y2||x1\xe2\x88\x92x2|+|y1\xe2\x88\x92y2|. \nSince she can not find this out, she wants your help.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line has TT, the number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the only line has an integer NN.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print multiple lines.\nIn the first line, print the number of points.\nIn the next lines, in each line, print two space separated integers, denoting the xx and yy coordinates of each point.\nIf there are multiple correct solutions, you may print any.\n\nSample Input\n2\n1\n3\n\nSample Output\n4\n0 0\n0 1\n1 0\n1 1\n4\n0 1\n1 3\n3 2\n2 0\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85shriram_c253\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SOPC014\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 constructive, math, shpc2019, shriram_c253\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

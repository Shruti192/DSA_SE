b"\n\nGiven an integer, , traverse its digits (1,2,...,n) and determine how many digits evenly divide  (i.e.: count the number of times  divided by each digit i has a remainder of ). Print the number of evenly divisible digits. \nNote: Each digit is considered to be unique, so each occurrence of the same evenly divisible digit should be counted (i.e.: for , the answer is ).Input FormatThe first line is an integer, , indicating the number of test cases. \nThe  subsequent lines each contain an integer, .  \nConstraints \n \nOutput FormatFor every test case, count and print (on a new line) the number of digits in  that are able to evenly divide .Sample Input2\n12\n1012\nSample Output2\n3\nExplanationThe number  is broken into two digits,  and . When  is divided by either of those digits, the calculation's remainder is ; thus, the number of evenly-divisible digits in  is .\nThe number  is broken into four digits, , , , and .  is evenly divisible by its digits , , and , but it is not divisible by  as division by zero is undefined; thus, our count of evenly divisible digits is .\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhrupanjan\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FINDDIG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, hrupanjan, math, solution\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n5000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, TEXT, NODEJS, RUBY, JS, FORT\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

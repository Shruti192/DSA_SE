In the store, they offer NN cans of coke (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the current temperature of the ii-th can is CiCi and its price is PiPi.\nAfter buying a can of coke, Chef wants to immediately start walking home; when he arrives, he wants to immediately drink the whole can. It takes Chef MM minutes to get home from the store.\nThe ambient temperature outside is KK. When a can of coke is outside, its temperature approaches the ambient temperature. Specifically, if its temperature is tt at some point in time:\n\nif t>K+1t>K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be t\xe2\x88\x921t\xe2\x88\x921\nif t<K\xe2\x88\x921t<K\xe2\x88\x921, then one minute later, its temperature will be t+1t+1\nif K\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4K+1K\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be KK\n\nWhen Chef drinks coke from a can, he wants its temperature to be between LL and RR (inclusive). Find the cheapest can for which this condition is satisfied or determine that there is no such can.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains five space-separated integers NN, MM, KK, LL and RR.\nNN lines follow. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers CiCi and PiPi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the price of the can Chef should buy, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to buy a can such that Chef's condition is satisfied.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n|Ci|\xe2\x89\xa450|Ci|\xe2\x89\xa450 for each valid ii\n|K|\xe2\x89\xa450|K|\xe2\x89\xa450\n\xe2\x88\x9250\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa450\xe2\x88\x9250\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid ii\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 2 5 4 6\n1 6\n2 8\n8 10\n3 5 10 20 30\n21 20\n22 22\n23 23\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef should buy the second can (with price 88), even though the first can is cheaper. If Chef bought the first can, its temperature would be 33 when he got home, and that is outside the range [4,6][4,6].\nExample case 2: No matter which can Chef buys, when he gets home, its temperature will be less than 2020, so there is no suitable can available in the store.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COKE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1511\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

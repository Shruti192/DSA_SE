b"\n Chefa and chef both are good at problem solving but they don't know who is better. So one day they decided to test their skills against each other. The strategy they took is, they will ask one question, if anyone failed to answer to its opponent then other one will treated as better. It is provided that Chefa is already failed to answer Chef's question and now its Chef's turn to answer Chef's question. Chefa question is as follow-\n Chef is given integers A1,A2,......,ANA1,A2,......,AN and asked to count number of pairs of (Ai,Aj)(Ai,Aj) such that, it satisfied the following conditions:\n\n LCM(Ai,Aj)=2GCD(Ai,Aj)LCM(Ai,Aj)=2GCD(Ai,Aj), Where 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N,1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N.1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N,1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N. \n (Ai,Aj)=(Aj,Ai)(Ai,Aj)=(Aj,Ai).\n\n Input \n\n First line of input contains number a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.  T lines follow. \n First line of each test case contains a single integer N denotes number of integers.\n The second line of each test case contains NN space separated integers AiAi. \n\n Output \n\n For each test case print the single integer in a new line denoting counts of each valid pairs.\n\n Constraints \n\n 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100 \n 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n 1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n Example \n Input \n1\n3\n2 3 4\n\n Output \n1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85dshahid380_\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LGCD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dshahid380_, enau2019, encoding, greatest-common-divisor, hashing, math\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

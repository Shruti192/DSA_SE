Chef's teacher gives the students some homework every day and it is compulsory to turn in the homework by the very next day. Chef knows that the number of minutes needed to complete the homework on the ii-th day is HiHi.\nChef hates homework and wants to spend the minimum amount of time possible in doing homework. Luckily, he has a few tricks up his sleeve. Chef can hack the school records on any given day to make it show that the assigned homework is complete. However to avoid suspicion, Chef will not hack the records strictly more than kk days consecutively.\nCan you help Chef find the minimum possible total number of minutes that Chef needs to spend on homework?\nNote: \n\nThere are multiple test cases in a single file, refer to Input section for more details.\nSince the input is large, it is recommended to use fast input/output methods.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TT, the number of test cases. The description of the TT test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk - the number of days in Chef's semester and the maximum number of consecutive days Chef can hack the school's record system.\nThe second line of each test case contains nn integers, H1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6HnH1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6Hn, where HiHi is the number of minutes Chef needs to complete the homework given on the ii-th day.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing an integer, the minimum number of minutes Chef needs to spend on homework.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x89\xa41030\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x89\xa4103 for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\nThe sum of nn over all test cases is at most 106106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n7 3\n213 124 156 263 149 6 62\n7 1\n476 457 232 130 849 95 749\n7 2\n601 35 45 304 449 452 190\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n130\n682\n484\n\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the first test case, Chef does his homework on days 22 and 66, taking a total of H2+H6=124+6=130H2+H6=124+6=130 minutes. The maximum number of consecutive days that Chef hacks is 33 (days 33, 44, and 55), which is not more than k=3k=3.\nIn the second test case, Chef does his homework on days 22, 44, and 66, taking a total of H2+H4+H6=457+130+95=682H2+H4+H6=457+130+95=682 minutes.\nIn the third test case, Chef does his homework on days 22 and 55, taking a total of H2+H5=35+449=484H2+H5=35+449=484 minutes.\n\nYou can verify that these are indeed the optimal solutions.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsrikkanth_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HMWPRB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Deque, Priority Queue, Monotonic stack, Segment Trees, Bottom-up\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Queues, Stacks, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2576\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-06-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

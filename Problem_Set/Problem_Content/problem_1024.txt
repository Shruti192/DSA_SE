The ithith friend recommends the Chef to buy the AithAithlaptop (1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410)(1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410).\nChef will buy the laptop which is recommended by maximum number of friends. Determine which laptop Chef buys.\nPrint CONFUSED if there are multiple laptops having maximum number of recommendations.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN - the number of Chef's friends.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN where AiAi denotes the recommendation of the ithith friend.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line, the laptop which has the maximum number of recommendations. Print CONFUSED if there are multiple laptops having maximum number of recommendations.\nYou may print each character of CONFUSED in uppercase or lowercase (for example, Confused, coNFused, CONFused will be considered identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n5\n4 4 4 2 1\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 6\n6\n2 2 3 3 10 8\n4\n7 7 8 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n6\nCONFUSED\nCONFUSED\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Laptop 44 has the maximum number of recommendations.

Therefore, Chef will buy the 6th6th laptop.\nTest case 3: Laptops 22, 33 have the maximum number of recommendations. Therefore, Chef will still be CONFUSED.\nTest case 4: Laptops 77, 88 have the maximum number of recommendations. Therefore, Chef will still be CONFUSED.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85jeevanjyot\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LAPTOPREC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 jeevanjyot, math, start37\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1104\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-05-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

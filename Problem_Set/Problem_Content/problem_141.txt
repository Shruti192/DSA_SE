It is not necessarily a red-blue tree, but its vertices are still coloured red and blue. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose two adjacent vertices and swap their colours.\nFind the smallest number of operations required to transform the tree into a red-blue tree or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nN\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that vertices uu and vv are connected by an edge.\nThe last line contains a string SS with length NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of this string is either \'0\' if the ii-th vertex is initially red or \'1\' if it is initially blue.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of operations or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to transform the tree into a red-blue tree.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100,000 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N \nSS contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1  \n7  \n1 2  \n1 3  \n2 4  \n2 5  \n3 6  \n3 7  \n0010010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can perform the following operations:\n\nSwap the colours of vertices 11 and 33; the string of colours becomes "1000010".\nSwap the colours of vertices 11 and 22; the string of colours becomes "0100010".\nSwap the colours of vertices 66 and 33; the string of colours becomes "0110000", so the tree is a red-blue tree.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85pandey__ji\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RBTREES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DFS, BFS, Bipartite\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Coloring\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2446\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

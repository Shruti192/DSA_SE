b'\n\xc2\xa0\nThe war has been declared in the Clash of Clans and the clan\'s leader has designed a smart strategy to confirm his side\'s victory in this war.\n\nHis strategy is as follows -\n\nWhen any member of his clan member will attack at any member of the enemy\'s clan then the attacker\'s army will consist of only two types of troops - Lava Hounds "L" and P.E.K.K.A. "P"(as these two are the mightiest troops),\nThe attacker\'s army should be balanced, i.e., if the attacker\'s army consists of N troops then in any continuous section of the army the difference between the number of P.E.K.K.A. and Lava Hounds must be atmost 2.\n\nAn army will be represented as a string of Lava Hounds "L" and P.E.K.K.A. "P".\n\nExample : If the army consists of N=5 troops, then there are 14 possible combinations for a balanced army ( condition number 2 ). The Lexicographical Order of this is - LLPLP, LLPPL, LPLLP, LPLPL, LPLPP, LPPLL, LPPLP, PLLPL, PLLPP, PLPLL, PLPLP, PLPPL, PPLLP and PPLPL.\n\nAll the possible balanced combinations of army of a certain length N can be ordered lexicographically with index starting from 1. Example for N=5, army at number 7 is LPPLP (see in the above example).\n\nSince the leader is busy in donating the troops to his clan members therefore he needs your help in finding the number(index) assigned to an army for a given value of N(number of P.E.K.K.A. and Lava Hounds in army).\nThere can be large number of such possible combinations for a particular value of N therefore output the result modulo M.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains N, the number of troops in the army.\nThe second line contains the value of modulo, M.\nThe third line contains a string of N characters "L" (Lava Hounds) or "P" (P.E.K.K.A.) that represents a balanced army.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nOutput the number assigned to the army modulo M.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\nSubtask 1: 20 Points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 250\n4 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 107\n\nSubtask 2: 80 Points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n4 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 107\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput 1:\n5\n4\nLPPLP\n\nOutput 1:\n3\n\nInput 2:\n1\n7\nP\n\nOutput 2:\n2\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1.The actual position of LPPLP in the list of possible combinations is 7. Therefore 7 modulo 4 is 3.

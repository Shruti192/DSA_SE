Help Charlie decide who is taller.\nIt is guaranteed that X\xe2\x89\xa0YX\xe2\x89\xa0Y.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer TT \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers XX and YY, as described in the problem statement. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a new line AA if Alice is taller than Bob, else output BB. \nThe output is case insensitive, i.e, both AA and aa will be accepted as correct answers when Alice is taller.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n100\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4200100\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4200\nX\xe2\x89\xa0YX\xe2\x89\xa0Y\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n150 160\n160 150\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nB\nA\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: In this case, 150<160150<160 so Bob is taller than Alice.\nTest case 22: In this case, 160>150160>150 so Alice is taller than Bob.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nlavish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TALLER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 lavish_adm, math, start36\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n281\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\nChef has NN items in his Shop (numbered 11 through NN); And for Each valid ii (11<=ii<=NN).       the weight of the i\xe2\x88\x92thi\xe2\x88\x92th item is WiWi. Since Chef is very sensitive in nature.\nChef wants to arrange all even weights items one side and odd weights items on another side. Chef can arrange two adjacent items with help of swapping at one operation.\nChef wants a minimum number of operations required to arrange All Even weights item on one side and All Odd weights item to the another side.\nChef can\xe2\x80\x99t solve this problem so he asks you to solve it. Help Chef to solve this problem.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nThe first line of each test case contains a single line integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers\nW1W1,W2W2,\xe2\x80\xa6,WNWN\n\nOutput:\nPrint the minimum number of operations required Chef can make it. If Chef can't take any operations, print 0.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n3\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41053\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSample Input:\n3\n6\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n5\n5 7 3 10 20\n3\n1 8 7\n\nSample Output:\n3\n0\n1\n\nEXPLANATION:\nExample case 1:  You can arrange all even numbers right side. \nNumbers of swaps 66 arrange at position 6th6th is 00 operations, 44 arrange at position 5th5th is 11 operations, 22 arrange at position 4th4th is 22 operations.\nGiven array [1,2,3,4,5,6][1,2,3,4,5,6] to [1,3,5,2,4,6][1,3,5,2,4,6]\nTotal : 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 operations\nExample case 2: Initially All odd number one side and all even number another side, so minimum number of operations : 0.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nthe_rtu_coders\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFRTU\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cbiz2020, easy, greedy, the_rtu_coders\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

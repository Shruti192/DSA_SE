b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\n\nSereja has a rooted tree of N nodes with node 1 being the root node. He wants to find the number of ways of assigning an integer in the range [1, M] to each node, such that value of each node should be a multiple of it's parent node's value (for vertex #1 there is no parent so any number fit condition). As the answer could be large, report it modulo (109 + 7).\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. T tests follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M. Each of the next N-1 lines contains two integers (u, v) \xe2\x80\x94 a pair of vertices connected by an edge. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer corresponding to the answer in separate line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 20000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree (i.e., there won't be any cycles or self-loops).\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 2\n1 2\n1 3\n1 100\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n100\n\n\nExplanation\n                    In first test case there are five possible assigns of numbers: [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]. \nIn second test case there are hundred possible assigns: [1], [2], [3], ..., [100].\n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\nsereja_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SEATR2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP on Trees, Number Theory, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2432\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-11-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

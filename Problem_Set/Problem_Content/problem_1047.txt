b'\nMoEngage has a bundle of NN sticks. The ithith stick has a length LiLi meters. \nFind the minimum number of sticks (of any length) you need to add to the bundle such that you can construct some rectangles where each stick of the bundle belongs to exactly one rectangle and each side of a rectangle should be formed with exactly one stick.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN, denoting the number of given sticks.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers L1,L2,\xe2\x80\xa6,LNL1,L2,\xe2\x80\xa6,LN, denoting the length of the sticks.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line, the minimum number of sticks you need to add to the bundle to satisfy the given conditions.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1\n1\n2\n2 5\n4\n2 2 3 3\n7\n1 3 5 7 1 7 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n0\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: One possible way is to add 33 sticks with lengths 1,2,1,2, and 22. Now, it is possible to construct a rectangle with one pair of opposite sides having a length of 11 and another pair of opposite sides having a length of 22.\nTest case 22: The optimal way is to add 22 sticks with lengths 22 and 55. Now, it is possible to construct a rectangle with one pair of opposite sides having a length of 22 and another pair of opposite sides having a length of 55.\nTest case 33: There is no need to add more sticks to the bundle as it is possible to construct a rectangle using the given sticks.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RECSTI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook140, implementation, math, simple, soumyadeep_21\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1555\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

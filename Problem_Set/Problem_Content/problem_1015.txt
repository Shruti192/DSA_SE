b'\nChef got into a fight with the evil Dr Doof. Dr Doof has decided to destroy all even numbers from the universe using his Evil-Destroy-inator. Chef has NN integers with him. To stop Doof, Chef has to find an odd number which is an integer multiple of all NN numbers that he has with him. Find if it is possible for Chef to prevent Dr Doof from destroying the even numbers.\nFormally, given NN positive integers, find if there exists an odd number which is an integer multiple of all the given NN numbers. If yes, print "YES", otherwise "NO". You can print any letter in any case.\nInput\n\nFirst line contains TT, number of testcases. Each testcase consists of 22 lines.\nThe first line of each test case consists of a positive integer NN, denoting the number of positive integers Chef has.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN space separated integers AiAi each denoting an integer that Chef has with him.\n\nOutput\nFor every test case, if there exists such an odd number, print "YES" on a separate line, otherwise "NO". The judge is case insensitive. That means, your code can print any letter in any case ( "Yes", "yes" or "YES" are all accepted).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\n1 2 5 4 3\n1\n7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nFor test 11: There exists no odd number.\nFor test 22: The possible odd numbers can be 77, 2121, 4949, 315315, \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85sarthakmanna\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLLCM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, LCM, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1108\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

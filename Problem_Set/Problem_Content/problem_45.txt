b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\nNaturally, the magical girl is very good at performing magic. She recently met her master wizard Devu, who gifted her R potions of red liquid, \nB potions of blue liquid, and G potions of green liquid.\n\n\n\nThe red liquid potions have liquid amounts given by r[1], ..., r[R] liters. \n\n\nThe green liquid potions have liquid amounts given by g[1], ..., g[G] liters. \n\n\nThe blue liquid potions have liquid amounts given by b[1], ..., b[B] liters. \n\n\nShe want to play with the potions by applying magic tricks on them. In a single magic trick, she will choose a particular color. Then she will pick all the potions of the chosen color and decrease the amount of liquid in them to half (i.e. if initial amount \nof liquid is x, then the amount after decrement will be x / 2  where division is integer division, e.g. 3 / 2 = 1 and 4 / 2 = 2). \n\nBecause she has to go out of station to meet her uncle Churu, a wannabe wizard, only M minutes are left for her. In a single minute, she can perform at most one magic trick. Hence, she can perform at most M magic tricks.\n\n\nShe would like to minimize the maximum amount of liquid among all of Red, Green and Blue colored potions. Formally Let v be the maximum value of amount of liquid in any potion. We want to minimize the value of v.\nPlease help her.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThen for each test case, we have four lines.\n\nThe first line contains four space separated integers R, G, B, M. The next 3 lines will describe the amount of different color liquids (r, g, b), which are separated by space.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single integer denoting the answer of the problem.\n\nConstraints\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000 \n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 R, G, B, M \xe2\x89\xa4 100 \n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 r[i], g[i], b[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9 \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 1 1 1\n1\n2\n3\n1 1 1 1\n2\n4\n6\n3 2 2 2\n1 2 3\n2 4\n6 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Magical girl can pick the blue potion and make its liquid amount half. So the potions will now have amounts 1 2 1. Maximum of these values is 2. Hence answer is 2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dpraveen\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shangjingbo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PRPOTION\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1609\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-09-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

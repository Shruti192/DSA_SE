Rinku has a favorite number maxmax and Simmi's favorite number is 22. Rinku asks Ankit to tell him the maximum value of NN such that the total number of ways of selecting the soups are less than Rinku's favorite number. The variety of different soups on Simmi's plate is at least equal to her favorite number. Note that bowls can also be empty.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach test case contains of a single line of input, one integers maxmax denoting Rinku's favorite number. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Ankit to Rinku modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4max\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4max\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n5\n150\n1000\n420\n100\n50\n\nSample Output:\n4\n6\n5\n4\n3\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85ankitjha97\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SOL01\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ankitjha97, combinatorics, dynamic-programming\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-05-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

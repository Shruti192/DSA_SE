b'\n\xc2\xa0\nFlash and QuickSilver challenge each other to a faceoff. They stand at the top of a huge staircase where the steps are numbered from n down to 1. In a single step, they can step down from stair n to stair n-1. Afraid of losing the challenge, flash bribes the judge and figures out a few tricks. If the stair number n is divisible by 2, he can jump directly to stair numbered n/2 in a single step. If the stair number n is divisble by 3, Flash can then jump directly to stair numbered n/3 in a single step. In order to win, one needs to reach the stair numbered 1, in minimum time. Assuming that both of them can take 1 step in 1 sec, calculate the minimum time required by Flash to reach the stair numbered 1.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line contains a positive integer t, denoting the number of test cases.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single positive integer n, denoting the number of stairs in the staircase.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the minimum time required(in seconds) by Flash to reach the stair number 1.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3\n1\n6\n10\n\nOutput:\n0\n2\n3\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nSince Flash is already at stair numbered 1, he will take no time.\n\nExample case 2.\nFlash is  at stair numbered 6, 6 -> 3, 3 -> 1. Hence he takes 2 seconds to reach the stair number 1.\n\nExample case 3.\nFlash is  at stair numbered 10, 10 -> 9, 9 -> 3, 3 -> 1. Hence he takes 3  seconds to reach the stair number 1\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85varuns_2729\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy, varuns_2729\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-04-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nOur Lonely Vijju is feeling sooo lonely that Sometimes he talks (rather shouts at god), "Why god, Why me!!!!, Where did i go wrong." The god had blessed him with only one thing ever, his IQ (Intelligence Quotient). He has the IQ NN.\nGod Taran had some mercy on him and granted him a superpower, that he can share his IQ with anyone and make him is friend. Formally, God Taran gave him an array BB of length KK. Vijju can partition his IQ into KK parts represented by array AA, with condition that 0\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4B[i]0\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4B[i]. If A[i]>B[i]A[i]>B[i], he will invite wrath of Mighty Taran, something he\'s deeply scared of and wants to avoid.\nBut, having high IQ, Vijju thinks the number of ways he can do so, without attracting Wrath of Lord Taran.\nVijju found this answer, but he ask you to verify his answer by solving this problem.\nTwo Partitions A1A1 and A2A2 differ if A1[i]\xe2\x89\xa0A2[i]A1[i]\xe2\x89\xa0A2[i] for any position i.\nVijju knows this problem is not for people with less IQ, so he ask you to find answer modulo 109+9109+9.\nInput\n\nFirst line contains an Integer TT denoting number of test cases. Each test case consist of two lines.\nFor every test case, First line contains two integers NN and KK, as explained above.\nNext line contains KK integers, specifying array BB.\n\nOutput\n\nFor every test case, output in a single line the number of ways to form array AA. If no possible array exist, print 0.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K,B[i]\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K,B[i]\xe2\x89\xa4100.            \n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (15 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask 2 (85 points): Original Constraints.\n\nSample Input\n2\n8 3\n3 3 3\n8 3\n4 4 4         \nSample Output\n3\n15\nExplanation\nIn first sample, all possible arrays AA are [2,3,3][2,3,3], [3,2,3][3,2,3] and [3,3,2][3,3,2].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85taran_1407\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/VIJJUPAR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy, icop1902, taran_1407, taran_1407\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

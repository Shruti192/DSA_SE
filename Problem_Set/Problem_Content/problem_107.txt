There are NN ranges [l1,r1],[l2,r2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[lN,rN][l1,r1],[l2,r2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[lN,rN]. Chefina wants to divide the ranges into two non-empty subsets in such a way that each range is in exactly one subset and whenever two ranges have a common point, they are in the same subset.\nSince this could be difficult to achieve, Chefina can delete any number of ranges (possibly zero) and then divide the remaining ranges into such non-empty subsets. She wants to know whether it is possible to achieve her task after deleting some ranges and if it is possible, she also wants to know the minimum number of ranges she needs to delete to achieve it.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.  \nNN lines follow. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers lili and riri.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of ranges to delete, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to delete some ranges and divide the remaining ranges into two non-empty subsets.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N=16N=16\nSubtask #2 (15 points): N=1,000N=1,000\nSubtask #3 (15 points): ri\xe2\x89\xa4106ri\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid ii\nSubtask #4 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n1 4\n2 6\n5 7\n2\n1 4\n4 6\n2\n3 7\n8 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n-1\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: It is enough to delete the range [2,6][2,6].\nExample case 2: There is no way to divide these two ranges into two suitable non-empty subsets and deleting any range obviously makes it impossible too.\nExample case 3: There is no need to delete any ranges, we can just put one range into one subset and the other range into the other subset.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFRAN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Maps, Hashmaps, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2159\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-04-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

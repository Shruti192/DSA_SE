He successfully completed this task and now, he would like you to solve it.\nYou are given two strings AA and BB, each with length NN. Let\'s index the characters in each string from 00 \xe2\x80\x95 for each ii (0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N), the i+1i+1-th characters of AA and BB are denoted by AiAi and BiBi respectively. You should convert AA to BB by performing operations of the following type:\n\nChoose a subset SS of the set {0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x921}{0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x921}.\nLet cc be the alphabetically smallest character among AxAx for all x\xe2\x88\x88Sx\xe2\x88\x88S.\nFor each x\xe2\x88\x88Sx\xe2\x88\x88S, replace AxAx by cc.\n\nYou should find the smallest necessary number of operations or report that it is impossible to convert AA to BB. If it is possible, you also need to find one way to convert AA to BB using this smallest number of operations. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains a single string AA.\nThe third line contains a single string BB.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible to convert AA to BB, print a single line containing the integer \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer KK \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of operations.\nThen, print KK lines describing the operations. Each of these lines should contain a positive integer ZZ, followed by a space and ZZ pairwise distinct space-separated integers from the set {0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x921}{0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x921} \xe2\x80\x95 the elements of SS.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n|A|=|B|=N|A|=|B|=N\nAA and BB contain only lowercase English letters\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): BB contains only characters \'a\' and \'b\'\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\nabcab\naabab\n3\naaa\naab\n2\nde\ncd\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 1 2 4\n3 0 1 3\n-1\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nFirst, we can choose S=(1,2,4)S=(1,2,4), so the character cc is \'b\' and the string AA after this operation is "abbab".\nThen, we choose S=(0,1,3)S=(0,1,3), so cc is \'a\', and AA becomes "aabab".\nThere is no way to convert AA to BB in only one operation.\n\nExample case 2: We can see that it is impossible to convert AA to BB since cc is always \'a\'.\nExample case 3: We can see again that it is impossible to convert AA to BB since cc cannot be \'c\'.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85vivek_1998299\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CONVSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1991\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

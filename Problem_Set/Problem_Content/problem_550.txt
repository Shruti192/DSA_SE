b'\nYou are given a tree consisting of NN nodes. The nodes are numbered from 11 to NN. The tree is rooted at the node 11. \nA tree is a connected undirected graph with N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 edges.\nFind the sum of the distance between nodes xx and yy over all tuples (u,v,x,yu,v,x,y) satisfying the following conditions:\n1)1) u<vu<v\n2)2) uu is the ancestor of node xx and vv is the ancestor of node yy.\n3)3) Neither of uu or vv is the ancestor of the other.\nSince the sum can be enormous, print it modulo (109+7)(109+7).\nNote:\n\nThe distance between two nodes of a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between these two nodes.\nNode xx is considered to be the ancestor of yy if xx lies on the path from 11 to yy.\nUsually, there is no bound on the stack memory and is equal to the total memory limit of 1.5 GB. But due to a system configuration issue, the stack limit for C++ is temporarily set to 8 MB. So, if you believe that your code requires a larger stack limit, please include this in your code.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test contains an integer NN, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.\nN\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. The ithith of these lines contains two space-separated integers uiui and vivi, denoting an edge between the nodes uiui and vivi.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the sum obtained modulo (109+7)(109+7).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N\nIt is guaranteed that the given nodes and edges construct a tree.\nThe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n2 5\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n2 5\n2 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\n8\n54\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: There is no such tuple satisfying the constraints.\nTest case 22: (2,3,2,3)(2,3,2,3) is the only valid tuple and distance between node 22 and node 33 is 22.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85satyam_343\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREEDIST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, DP on Trees, Dynamic Programming, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3185\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

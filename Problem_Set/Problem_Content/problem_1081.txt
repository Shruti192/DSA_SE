For each valid ii, the ii-th road connects provinces UiUi and ViVi. It is possible to travel from each province to any other province using these roads.\nFor each valid ii, the annual income of the ii-th province is AiAi and its population is BiBi. The per-capita income of some provinces is lower than that of some other provinces. For this reason, the king of Chefland wants to choose one or more provinces to keep in his kingdom and abandon the rest, in such a way that the per-capita income of the whole resulting kingdom, i.e. the sum of annual incomes of the chosen provinces divided by the sum of their populations, would be maximum possible. However, it should also be possible to travel from each of the chosen provinces to any other chosen province without visiting any of the abandoned provinces. Among all such ways to form the new kingdom, the king would prefer the number of chosen provinces to be as large as possible.\nCan you help the king choose which provinces should form the new kingdom? If there are multiple solutions that maximise the per-capita income, you should choose one with the maximum number of chosen provinces. If there are still multiple solutions, you may choose any one.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN.\nMM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers UiUi and ViVi.\n\nOutput\nPrint two lines.\n\nThe first of these lines should contain a single integer KK denoting the number of provinces the king should choose.\nThe second line should contain KK space-separated integers denoting these provinces.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ui,Vi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ui,Vi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\nUi\xe2\x89\xa0ViUi\xe2\x89\xa0Vi for each valid ii\nthere is at most one road between each pair of provinces\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 3\n10 1 2\n5 1 1 \n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 3\n\n\nExplanation\nIf the king chooses provinces 11 and 33, then the per-capita income is 10+25+1=210+25+1=2.

b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nArrays have fallen out of Chef's good books, and he plans to destroy all arrays he possesses. He is left with the last array A, consisting of N positive integers.  In order to destroy the array, he can perform the following 2 types of operations any number of times.\n\nChoose any 2 elements, say X and Y, from the given array A such that X != Y, and remove them, or\nChoose any 1 element, say X, from A, and remove it.\n\n\nIn order to destroy the array as quickly as possible, Chef is interested in knowing the minimum number of operations required to destroy it. Please help him achieve this task.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains a single integer N \xe2\x80\x94 the number of integers in the array A.\nSecond line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the array A.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the required answer in a new line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 50000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nsum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5 \xc3\x97 105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n1 2\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n2\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTest 1: In an operation, Chef can choose 2 elements X and Y such that X = 1 and Y = 2 and can destroy them as X != Y.\nTest 2: Chef cannot choose 2 elements X and Y such that X != Y. So, he has to use the second operation twice in order to destroy the array.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85ma5termind\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85antoniuk1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DESTROY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Priority Queue, 1D Arrays, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Queues, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2031\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-11-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

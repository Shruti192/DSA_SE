b'\n\xc2\xa0\n\nFlippy the Bird has proposed n problems for the MCO qualifiers. He has labelled the problems from 1 to n. Fluffy the Squirrel has reviewed the problems, and assigned a difficulty rating di for each problem. The contest problems must have consecutive problem numbers. This means that the contest problems must have labels x, x + 1, ..., y for two positive  integers x and y. He believes a contest is balanced if there are at least l problems and at most r problems. Additionally, the average difficulty rating of the problems must be at most A. Flippy wants to set A to some real number (which means it might have decimal places) so that Fluffy can choose the problems for the contest in at least k ways, where k is a positive integer. Flippy wants A to be as small as possible. Find the optimal value of A.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line contains 4 positive integers n, l, r, k, the number of problems, minimum and maximum number of problems in a balanced contest, and the minimum number of ways that Fluffy can select the problems for the contest. The next line contains n space-seperated integers, denoting the difficulty level of the problems. \n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOutput a single real number, A, as explained in the problem statement. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 0.01.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 di \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 l \xe2\x89\xa4  r \xe2\x89\xa4 n\nk will not exceed the number of ways to choose the problems when A = 106\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (7 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 300\nSubtask 2 (13 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\nSubtask 3 (30 points) : l = 1, r = n\nSubtask 4 (50 points) : Original Constraints\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n5 2 3 4\n1 5 3 6 4\n\nOutput:\n4.33333333\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case. Indeed, there are 4 ways to choose the problems so that the average is at most 4.33333333. (or more precisely 13/3, but the error is less than 0.01 so this is accepted) The 4 choices are {1, 5}, {1, 5, 3}, {3, 6, 4}, {5, 3}.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85zscoder\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MCO16503\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 binary-search, binary-search-tree, dynamic-programming, zscoder\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-11-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

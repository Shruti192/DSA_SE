b'\nYou have nn Jenga blocks, with values written on them from 11 to nn. There will be exactly 11 block, with value = ii (ii belongs to range [1,n]).\nYou organised the Jenga Blocks in the form of a stack, in increasing order of their values, with the top-most block having value equal to 11 and the bottom-most block having value equal to nn.\nYour one friend is gonna play with you. In every turn of this Modified Jenga Game, your friend will select a unique block with value equal to xx, and your friend will note down the number of blocks placed above the block, with value xx, after that, you will remove that block from the stack in such a way that the stack remains intact and will put it on the top. \nYou will play this game for qq turns. \nUnfortunately, your friend lost the notes, he was noting down.\nBut, since you know the value of xx, for each of the qq turns, please make the notes again to help him.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain nn, the number of Jenga Blocks you have.\nSecond line will an integer qq, the number of turns.\nNext qq lines will contain an integer xx, which was selected by your friend in each turn.\n\nOutput:\nOutput the notes of your friend, in the form of qq space-seperated integers each denoting the number of blocks above the block numbered xx, before its moved by you.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\nSample Input:\n8\n2\n7 \n7 \n\nSample Output:\n6 0\n\nExplanation:\n\nInitial Stack: (Top)(Top) 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 (Bottom)(Bottom)\n1st move of your friend: Your friend will write 66 in his notes, because there are 6 blocks placed above 77.\nYour 1st Move: You move block with value = 77 to top.\nStack (After Whole 1st move): (Top)(Top) 77 11 22 33 44 55 66 88 (Bottom)(Bottom)\n2nd move of your friend: Your friend will write 00 in his notes, because there are 0 block(s) placed above 77.\nYour 2nd Move: You move block with value = 77 to top.\nStack (After Whole 2nd move): (Top)(Top) 77 11 22 33 44 55 66 88 (Bottom)(Bottom)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85vok_8\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WINLS1\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 advc2020, algorithm, bitwise-operation, codechef, college-chapter, data-structure, fenwick-tree, logical, math, med-hard, medium-hard, segment-tree, vok_8\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

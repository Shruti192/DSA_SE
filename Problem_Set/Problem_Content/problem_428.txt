b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nWe say that a binary string (a string containing only characters \'0\' and \'1\') is pure if it does not contain either of the strings "0101" or "1010" as a subsequence.\nRecall that string T is a subsequence of string S if we can delete some of the letters of S (possibly none) such that the resulting string will become T.\nYou are given a binary string SS with length NN. We want to make this string pure by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from it. What is the minimum number of characters we have to delete?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string SS with length NN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of characters we have to delete from SS.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4401\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa440\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSS contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n010111101\n1011100001011101\n0110\n111111\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n0\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can delete the first and third character of our string. There is no way to make the string pure by deleting only one character.\nExample case 3: The given string is already pure, so the answer is zero.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kmaaszraa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PRFYIT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 brute-force, cook113, dynamic-programming, easy, kmaaszraa, kmaaszraa\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2344\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

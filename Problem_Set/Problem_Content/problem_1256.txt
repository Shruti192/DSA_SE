b"\nPayton likes numbers, but all the numbers he has ever known are the ordinary integers, and he doesn't like it. Thus he created his own set of \xe2\x80\x9cnumbers\xe2\x80\x9d, which he called Payton numbers.\nEach Payton number is a triplet of ordinary integers (a,b,c), with the restriction that c is either 11 or 24 (because Payton likes 11 and 24). And then, Payton defines the product of two Payton numbers (a1,b1,c1) and (a2,b2,c2) as the following: \ndef multiply((a1,b1,c1), (a2,b2,c2)):\n\n    s = (a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2) + (a1b2 + b1a2) + (c1 + c2)\n    t = floor[s/2] + 16(c1 + c2) - c1c2\n    A = (t - 2(a1b2 + b1a2) - (a1c2 + c1a2) + 33(a1 + a2)\n           + (b1b2 - a1a2))\n    B = (t - 5(a1b2 + b1a2) - (c1b2 + b1c2) + 33(b1 + b2)\n           + (2b1b2 + 4a1a2))\n\n    if s is even:\n        return (A-540,B-540,24)\n    else:\n        return (A-533,B-533,11)\n\nEventually, Payton found out that he can define many interesting things about his numbers:\nA zero is a Payton number z whose product with any other Payton number is z. Payton proved that there is a unique zero in Payton numbers, namely (11,11,11).\nA unity is a Payton number whose product with any other Payton number is that Payton number. Payton proved that there is a unique unity in Payton numbers, namely (4,4,24).\nA Payton number x divides another Payton number y if there exists a Payton number z such that x\xc2\xb7z = y.\nA Payton number is a unit if it divides a unity. Payton proved that any unity is also a unit, therefore (4,4,24) is a unit. But it's possible that there are other units.\nA Payton number is prime if it isn't a zero, isn't a unit, and can't be written as the product of two nonzero, non-unit Payton numbers.\nGiven a Payton number, Payton wants to determine whether it is prime or not. Please help him, so that he can start replacing all numbers in math with Payton numbers!\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of one line which contains three integers, a, b and c, representing the Payton number (a,b,c).\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a word: \xe2\x80\x9cPRIME\xe2\x80\x9d if the Payton number is a prime, and \xe2\x80\x9cNOT PRIME\xe2\x80\x9d otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 104\nc is either 11 or 24\n\n \nSubtasks\n\n Subtask #1: (30 points) -104 \xe2\x89\xa4 a, b \xe2\x89\xa4  104\n Subtask #2: (70 points) -107 \xe2\x89\xa4 a, b \xe2\x89\xa4  107\n\n \nExample\nInput:\n4\n11 11 11\n4 4 24\n-104 126 11\n4 5 24\n\nOutput:\nNOT PRIME\nNOT PRIME\nNOT PRIME\nPRIME\n\n\n \nExplanation\nExample case 1. The number (11,11,11) is a zero, so it's not prime.\nExample case 2. The number (4,4,24) is a unit, so it's not prime.\nExample case 3. The number (-104,126,11) is not a prime, since it is the product of two nonzero non-units (13,26,24) and (4,-8,11).\nExample case 4. It can be shown that the number (4,5,24) isn't a zero, isn't a unit, and cannot be factored into two nonzero non-units. Therefore it is prime.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85pushkarmishra\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CUSTPRIM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Rabin Miller Test, Primes\n                 \n                     \n                     Number Theory, Primality Checking\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3242\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-12-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

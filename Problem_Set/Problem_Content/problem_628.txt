b"\nSaitama finally got a date! However, his date, Fubuki,  was not impressed by him. She wanted to see how clever Saitama was.  Hence she asked him a question. \nSaitama was given a list of numbers by his date, let the list be N=[a1,a2,a3........an].N=[a1,a2,a3........an].\nSaitama's task is to find out how many elements in the list is made up by combining other numbers from the list. He can combine a number A more than once to form number B. \nYour task is to help Saitama in his endeavour and help him count the number of numbers in the list which were formed by combining other numbers present in the list. \nNote: You cannot rearrange the digits of the number.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain NN, the number of numbers in the list.\nThe next line contains NN space-separated numbers a1,a2,a3,.....aNa1,a2,a3,.....aN. \n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line the number of numbers in the list which were formed by combining other numbers present in the list.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41e+100\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41e+10\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all lengths of a1 and N do not exceed 10^7\nSample Input:\n    5\n    1 11 123 2 23\n\nSample Output:\n    2\n\nEXPLANATION:\n11  can be made with 1 and 1, 123 can be made from 1 and 23. The constituents of the other numbers are not present in the list.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85arnie8991\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ECJAN20G\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 arnie8991, depth-first-search, dynamic-programming, enja2020\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

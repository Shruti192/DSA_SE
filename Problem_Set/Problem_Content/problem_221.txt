b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\nYou are given a array A of N positive integers, and you can perform the following operation on the array\n1) Pick any two indices i and j in the array\n2) Divide A[i] and A[j] by some common factor of A[i] and A[j]\n\nYou can perform the above operation as many number of times as you want, and the aim is to minimize the product of the resulting array. Find this minimum product. Since the answer can be a large number, print the product modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\n\nINPUT:\nFirst line contains T, number of testcases. Each testcase contains 2 lines.\nFirst line of each testcase contains single integer N, size of the array\nSecond line of each testcase contains N space separated integers, the array A\n\nOUTPUT:\nFor each testcase, output single line indicating the answer to that testcase\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1<=T<=10\n30 points : 1<=N<=2000, 1<=A[i]<=106\n70 points : 1<=N<=20000, 1<=A[i]<=108\n\nSAMPLE INPUT:\n1\n3\n2 3 6\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT:\n1\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFirst divide first and third numbers by 2, then the second and third by 3. This makes all numbers equal to 1, hence the product is 1.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85piyushkumar\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85balajiganapath\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MPROD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Prime Divisors, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Divisors, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2314\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-04-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

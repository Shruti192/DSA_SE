b'\nAn input string SS of length NN is transferred through the network using a special protocol. The protocol can send the string through a series of operations. In one operation, we can choose a lowercase english alphabet CC and do one of the following:\n\nTransfer 11 copy of CC through the network.\nTransfer 22 copies of CC through the network.\n\nEach of the above transfers take 11 unit of time.\nFind the minimum time in which we can transfer the entire string SS through the network.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains NN - the length of the string SS. \nSecond line of each test case contains the string SS.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line, the minimum time required to transfer the string. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105. \nString SS contains lowercase english alphabets only.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\ncbcdc\n6\naabeee\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 11: String can be transferred through following operations: send 11 copy of character cc, send 11 copy of character bb, send 11 copy of character cc, send 11 copy of character dd, and send 11 copy of character cc. Thus, total 55 operations are required. \nTest Case 22: String can be transferred through following operations: send 22 copies of character aa, send 11 copy of character bb, send 11 copy of character ee, and send 22 copies of character ee. Thus, total 44 operations are required. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85sg1729\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STRP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, greedy, sg1729, start29, strings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1065\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

For each valid ii, there are MiMi ants on the ii-th line.\nFor each valid ii and jj, the jj-th ant on the ii-th line initially has a non-zero coordinate Xi,jXi,j with the following meaning:\n\nThe distance of this ant from OO is |Xi,j||Xi,j|.\nLet's choose a direction along the ii-th line from OO. The exact way in which this direction is chosen does not matter here, it only needs to be the same for all ants on the same line.\nIf Xi,jXi,j is positive, this ant is at the distance |Xi,j||Xi,j| from OO in the chosen direction. Otherwise, it is at this distance from OO in the opposite direction.\n\nIn other words, two ants jj and kk on a line ii are at the same side of OO if the signs of Xi,jXi,j and Xi,kXi,k are the same or on opposite sides if the signs are different.\nAll ants move with the same constant speed. Initially, all of them are moving towards OO. Whenever two or more ants meet (possibly at OO), all of these ants turn around and start moving in the opposite directions with the same speed. We call this a collision. Even if an ant reaches OO without meeting an ant there, it keeps moving in the same direction. An ant may change direction multiple times.\nHelp Chef find the total number of collisions between ants. Note that even if more than two ants meet, it counts as only one collision.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nNN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains an integer MiMi, followed by a space and MiMi space-separated integers Xi,1,Xi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Xi,MiXi,1,Xi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Xi,Mi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of collisions between ants.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Mi\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4Mi\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|Xi,j|\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4|Xi,j|\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i,ji,j\nXi,j<Xi,j+1Xi,j<Xi,j+1 for each valid i,ji,j\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of M1+M2+\xe2\x80\xa6+MNM1+M2+\xe2\x80\xa6+MN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): N=1N=1\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n2 -2 1\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: First, the ants on the first line collide at the coordinate \xe2\x88\x921/2\xe2\x88\x921/2 and change directions. Finally, ant 22 on the first line collides with the only ant on the second line; this happens at OO. No collisions happen afterwards.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85arayi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ANTSCHEF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 arayi, easy-medium, greedy, implementation, jan21, observation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2244\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

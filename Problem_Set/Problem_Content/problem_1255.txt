b'\n          \n            Ms. Khan likes eating chocolates, she has BB number of chocolates in her bag. Ms. Khan becomes happy if she gets a gift box filled with a number of chocolates AA which is divisible by the chocolates she already have (BB) in her bag. To make Ms. Khan happy, Mr. Hawk is preparing a gift box which already have XX number of chocolates inside. And Mr. Hawk puts one chocolate every day in that box. Find out the minimum number of days will Mr. Hawk take to prepare the box of Ms. Khan\xe2\x80\x99s happiness i.e, make XX number of chocolates divisible by chocolates in Ms. Khan\xe2\x80\x99s bag. Answer is zero if chocolates in gift box are already divisible by chocolates in bag. (as Mr. Hawk will not need any time to prepare the gift box).\nYou have to answer TT independent testcases.\n\nInput:\n\n- First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase contains a single line of input, two integers X,BX,B. \n\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each testcase, output is a single line answering the minimum number of days required to prepare the box.\n\n\nConstraints \n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\n 1\xe2\x89\xa4X,B\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4X,B\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n\n\nSample Input:\n4\n2 4\n10 4\n92 46\n123 456\n\n\n\nSample Output:\n2\n2\n0\n333\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\n\nIn case 3 : the gift box is already prepared\nIn case 1: the box will get prepared after two days\nIn case 2: Mr. hawk will need two days to prepare the gift box\nIn case 4: Mr. hawk will need 333 days to prepare the gift box i.e. after 333 days the gift box will have 456 chocolates, which is divisible by 456.\n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85h4wk\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HWKGB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cwtc2020, easy, h4wk, math\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, PYPY, NODEJS, PHP\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Potter\xe2\x80\x99s first day at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\nHarry is very anxious about the house sorting ceremony which is about to take place.The headmaster of the school, Albus Dumbledore has introduced a new way of sorting the students .For every student, Dumbledore will create a special string SS out of his magic and each student has to create his/her own special string PP with the help of the magic wand.The sorting hat will sort the students into their favourite house if their string PP is charming with Dumbledore\xe2\x80\x99s string SS, otherwise the students will be sorted into the house which they hate the most.\nA string PP is charming with string SS if the string SS has an even number of substrings which are twin strings of PP. String TT is a Twin of string PP if the magic power of both the strings are  equal.The magic power of a string is defined as the sum of powers of each alphabet in a string.The power of a alphabet is its respective position in the first 26 alphabets i.e; power  of \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99b\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99k\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99z\xe2\x80\x99 are 1,2,3,11,26 respectively.\nNow Harry\xe2\x80\x99s wish is to be sorted into GRYFFINDOR and also he can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine being sorted to SLYTHERIN.Given the special string of Harry and Dumbledore, help Harry determine the house he will be sorted into.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T , number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line each testcase will contain N, the length of string S\nSecond line of each testcase will contain the string S\nThird line of each testcase will contain the string P\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "GRYFFINDOR" if Harry is sorted to gryffindor or "SLYTHERIN" otherwise (without quotes)\nConstraints:\n\nT<=100T<=100\nN<=10000N<=10000\n|P|<=|S||P|<=|S|\nS and P contains only lowercase alphabets\n\nSample Input:\n2\n5\nabcde\neah\n3\nabc\nif\n\nSample Output:\nSLYTHERIN\nGRYFFINDOR\nExplanation:\nFor test case 1, the magical power of string "eah" is 5+1+8=14,\n"bcde" is the only substring in "abcde" with magical power 14.\nSince the string "abcde" has odd number of twin strings of "eah", Harry will be sorted to Slytherin\nFor test case 2 ,the magical power of string "if" is 9+6=15 ,\nSince there are no substrings of "abc" with magical power 15, Harry will be sorted to Gryffindor. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85hareesh29\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AOC05\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aoc2020, dynamic-programming, hareesh29\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\nThe mayor of Townsville City wants to build a telephone network in the city.\nThe city is represented as a square grid of size NN x NN. Rows and columns of the grid are numbered from 11 to NN. Each cell of the grid (i,j)(i,j) has a tower of height Hi,jHi,j. The height of each tower is between 11 and KK (inclusive). It is guaranteed that there is at least one tower of each height in the city.\n\nThe mayor's engineering team wants to use exactly K\xe2\x88\x921K\xe2\x88\x921 cables to create the network.\nThe first cable should be between a tower of height 11 and a tower of height 22, the second cable should be between a tower of height 22 and a tower of height 33, and so on with the (K\xe2\x88\x921)th(K\xe2\x88\x921)th cable connecting a tower of height (K\xe2\x88\x921)(K\xe2\x88\x921) and a tower of height KK, i.e., a chain of cables needs to be created in the height order 1,2,3,...,K1,2,3,...,K.\nThe cost of connecting two cells (i1,j1)(i1,j1) and (i2,j2)(i2,j2) is |i2\xe2\x88\x92i1|+|j2\xe2\x88\x92j1||i2\xe2\x88\x92i1|+|j2\xe2\x88\x92j1|.\nFor all ii such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<K1\xe2\x89\xa4i<K, the ithith and (i+1)th(i+1)th cables should have one tower in common.\n\nFind the minimum total cost of the chain of cables required to build the telephone network.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains 22 space-separated integers NN and KK.\nNN lines follow. Each line contains NN space-separated integers. The jthjth number in the ithith line represents Hi,jHi,j.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the minimum cost of cables used.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N21\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N2\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Hi,j\xe2\x89\xa4K1\xe2\x89\xa4Hi,j\xe2\x89\xa4K for each valid (i,j)(i,j)\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 100100\n\nExample Input\n1\n3 3\n1 1 1\n2 2 2\n3 3 3\n\nExample Output\n2\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: \n\nOne of the chains that can be formed with minimum cost is (1,1)(1,1) -> (2,1)(2,1) -> (3,1)(3,1) with cost 22.\nEven though (1,2)(1,2) -> (2,3)(2,3) -> (3,1)(3,1) is also a valid chain (among other valid chains), it's cost is 55 which is not the minimum.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85wittyceaser\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TELNET\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Loops, Basic Maths, Dynamic Programming, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

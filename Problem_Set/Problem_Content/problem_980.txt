b'\nA binary string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters of the string are equal. Formally, a binary string TT of length MM is called alternating if Ti\xe2\x89\xa0Ti+1Ti\xe2\x89\xa0Ti+1 for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<M1\xe2\x89\xa4i<M. \nFor example, 0, 1, 01, 10, 101, 010, 1010 are alternating strings while 11, 001, 1110 are not.\nYou are given a binary string SS of length NN. You would like to rearrange the characters of SS such that the length of the longest alternating substring of SS is maximum. Find this maximum value.\nA binary string is a string that consists of characters 0 and 1. A string aa is a substring of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The TT test cases then follow:\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN.\nThe second line of each test case contains the binary string SS.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the maximum possible length of the longest alternating substring of SS after rearrangement.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSS contains only the characters 0 and 1.\nSum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n110\n4\n1010\n4\n0000\n7\n1101101\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n1\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: Swapping the second and third characters makes S=101S=101. Hence the length of the longest alternating substring is 33 (choosing the entire string as a substring).\nTest case 22: The given string S=1010S=1010 is an alternating string of length 44.\nTest case 33: The length of the longest alternating substring is 11 for any rearrangement of  S=0000S=0000.\nTest case 44: One possible rearrangement of SS is 110101\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x931110101_1, which has an alternating substring of length 55 (the substring starting at index 22 and ending at index 66). \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ALTSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 math, simple, soumyadeep_21, start31, strings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1116\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

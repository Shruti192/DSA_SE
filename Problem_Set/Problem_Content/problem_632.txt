b'\n\xc2\xa0\nLittle John just had his first class in school.  He was taught first 20 letters of English alphabet and was asked to make words from these alphabets. Since he doesn\'t know many dictionary words, he quickly finished this work by making random strings from these alphabets.\nNow while other kids are busy creating their words, John gets curious and puts all the strings he created in a list and named it X.\n\nHe picks two indices \'i\' and \'j\'  ( not necessarily distinct). He assigns A as X[i] and B as X[j]. He then concatenates both the strings to create a new string C ( = A + B ). He calls a string "super string" if that string contains all the 20 letters of English alphabet he has just learnt,atleast once.\n\nGiven the strings of the list, can you tell him how many such unordered  pairs (i,j) he can choose such that string C is a super string. \n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer, N denoting the number of strings in X\nNext N lines contain one string each, i.e, the strings in X.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer, the number of unordered pairs  (i,j) , not necessarily distinct such that they follow the above condition. \n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 50 where |S| is the length of any string in input \n Each string contains characters only from  first 20 alphabets of Uppercase English alphabets i.e. A,B, ... T\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n\n4 \nACOKIPNEJOIR\nPFEKKRRA\nACOKIPNEJOIR\nTSBCDFGHJLMQ\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\n2\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nThe first string   (ACOKIPNEJOIR), if  concatenated with the fourth string  (TSBCDFGHJLMQ)  contains all alphabets from A,B...T. Similarly for the 3rd string  and 4th string.\nOn the other hand consider pair (1,1) :\nHere A=ACOKIPNEJOIR and B=ACOKIPNEJOIR\nC=ACOKIPNEJOIRACOKIPNEJOIR,which doesn\'t contain several alphabets, for example \'B\' and \'D\' are absent in C, therefore it is not a valid pair.\nSimilarly,no other pairs satisfy this criteria.\nTherefore the valid pairs are (1,4) and (3,4).\n\n Note: Large I/O data . Use faster I/O methods .

b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN integers in an array AA. \nTwo players take turns alternatively in placing signs (+ or -) before them, and then they all are added. The sign can be placed before any element of the array that has not been assigned a sign yet. All elements must be assigned a sign.\nPlayer 11 wins if the resulting sum is even, else player 22 wins. Find out who shall win if they both play optimally. \nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains 22 lines of input. \nFirst line contains a single integer NN, size of the array.\nSecond line contains NN space separated integers -  A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, denoting the array elements.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line "1", if the first person wins or "2" if the second person wins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 1 2\n3\n1 2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nCase 1: Lets consider all possible choices to prove that person 22 always has a winning chance regardless of what person 11 does.\n1) Suppose person 11 adds a positive sign to 11, person 22 can also add a positive sign to 22 to get total of 33 which is odd: (+1)+(+2)=3(+1)+(+2)=3 \n2) Suppose person 11 adds a negative sign to 11, person 22 can add a positive sign to 22 to get total of 11 which is odd: (\xe2\x88\x921)+(+2)=1(\xe2\x88\x921)+(+2)=1\n3) Suppose person 11 adds a positive sign to 22, person 22 can also add a positive sign to 11 to get total of 33 which is odd: (+2)+(+1)=3(+2)+(+1)=3 \n4) Suppose person 11 adds a negative sign to 22, person 22 can add a positive sign to 11 to get total of \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 which is odd: (\xe2\x88\x922)+(+1)=\xe2\x88\x921(\xe2\x88\x922)+(+1)=\xe2\x88\x921\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85akashbhalotia\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EVENGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arithmetic\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

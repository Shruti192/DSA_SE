b'\nEveryone is busy buying colours and water guns for HOLI. Chef being  small,  can\xe2\x80\x99t buy colours or guns on his own. So, his elder sister Chefina was given the task of buying those colours and other stuff and distribute them between Chef and herself. But Chefina proved to be a mischiveous.\nShe wants an answer from Chef and in return she will give Chef his part of the colours and water guns provided Chef gives the correct answer.\nThe question Chefina asks Chef is in the form of a string of digits which is manipulated as follow: \nIn the chosen string Chefina changed perfect square digits 44 and 99 with the square root of these numbers written twicetwice simultaneously instead of them. For example if string is \xe2\x80\x9814\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\x9814\xe2\x80\xb2 then chefina gives \xe2\x80\x98122\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\x98122\xe2\x80\xb2 to chef.\nSo Chef\xe2\x80\x99s work is to count thepossible number of strings that Chefina might have used to make up the manipulated string in the question.\nBut since Chef is a small child he gives this work to you and asks for your help. Your task is to help Chef get his share of colours.\nAlso since this number can be quite large, tell Chef instead its remainder when divided by 109+7109+7.\nPrint 00 if chefina gave a faulty manipulated string of digits.\n\nInput:\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, a string SS consisting of digits from 1 to 9. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer i.e. count of the number of strings that Chefina might have used to make up the manipulated string in the question.\n\nConstraints\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1(20 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410, 1\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa4201\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa420\nSubtask #2(30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450, 1\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask #3(50 points): Original Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n3\n12215678133\n121315\n1456688\n\nSample Output:\n4\n1\n0\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor the first case, the chosen strings of digits could be:- "12215678133", "1221567819", "1415678133", and "141567819". \nFor the second case, there is only one:- "121315" because no two consecutive 2s or 3s are there in the initial string.\nFor the last case, there will be no such strings which Chefina could have chose to make a manipulated string like:  "1456688", since the resulting string will not have 4 in it after manipulating it.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\npec_chapter\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CCHO\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cbhe2021, dynamic-programming, easy-medium, pec_chapter\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-03-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nWe all know Gru loves Agnes very much. One day Agnes asked Gru to answer some of her queries. She lined up NN minions in a straight line from 11 to NN. \nYou are given an array AA which contains the height of minions. Agnes will ask him several queries. In each query, Gru has to tell whether the bitwise AND of  A[L\xe2\x80\xa6R]A[L\xe2\x80\xa6R] is EVEN or ODD. Since Gru is busy planning the biggest heist on Earth, he asks for your help.\nInput:\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer TT denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each test case:-\nFirst line contains an integer NN denoting the number of elements.\nSecond line contains NN spaced integer representing array elements.\nThird line contains QQ representing number of query.\nNext QQ lines contains two integer LL and RR as defined above.\n\nOutput:\nFor each query, output "EVEN" or "ODD" without quotes.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 3 2 4 5\n3\n1 2 \n1 5\n3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nODD\nEVEN\nEVEN\n\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first query, the bitwise AND of 1 and 3 is 1, which is Odd. Hence the first output is ODD.\nFor the third query, the bitwise AND of 2 and 4 is 0, which is Even. Hence the third output is EVEN.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85tds115\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MINIAND\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bitwise Operation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1567\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

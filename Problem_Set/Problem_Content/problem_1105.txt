b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a clock, but it got broken today \xe2\x80\x94 the minute hand on Chef's clock doesn't rotate by the angle 2\xcf\x80/3600 each second, but by a different fixed angle x. The coordinates of the center of the clock are (0, 0). The length of the minute hand is l.\nOne endpoint of the minute hand is always located at the clock center; the other endpoint is initially located at the point (0, l). One second later, Chef observes that this endpoint is at distance d above the x-axis, i.e. the y-coordinate of this endpoint is equal to d.\nChef is curious about where the minute hand will be (specifically, its y-coordinate) after t seconds. Because t can be very large, Chef can't wait for that moment. Please help him!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers l, d and t.\n\nOutput\nWe can prove that for the given constraints, the y-coordinate of the end of the minute hand can always be written as a rational number p / q, where gcd(p, q) = gcd(q, 109 + 7) = 1. Let's denote the modular inverse of q (it's guaranteed that the modular inverse exists and is unique) by r.\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one number (p \xc2\xb7 r) modulo 109 + 7.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 d < l \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points): t \xe2\x89\xa4 3\nSubtask #2 (15 points): t is a power of 2, i.e. t = 2p for some p \xe2\x89\xa5 0\nSubtask #3 (40 points): sum of t over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 106\nSubtask #4 (40 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4 2 1\n4 2 2\n4 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1000000005\n1000000003\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nExample case 2:\n\nThe y-coordinate is -2, so the answer is 1000000005.\nExample case 3:\n\nThe y-coordinate is -4, so the answer is 1000000003.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85chemthan\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85r_64\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BROCLK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modulo Multiplicative Inverse, Matrix Exponentiation, Trigonometry\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic, Matrices, Basic Maths, Matrix Multiplication\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2193\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-08-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

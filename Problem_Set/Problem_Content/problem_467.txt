b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN) and a non-negative integer xx. The nodes of the tree have non-negative integer weights; let's denote the weight of node ii by aiai.\nNext, let's define the XOR value of a tree as the bitwise XOR of weights of all its nodes.\nChef wants to remove zero or more edges from his tree in such a way that each individual tree in the forest formed by removing these edges has XOR value xx. Help him compute the number of ways to remove a set of edges such that this condition is satisfied. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and xx.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\nEach of the following N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting an edge between nodes uu and vv in Chef's tree.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of ways to remove edges, modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4100N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa45,000N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 \n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nThere are five valid ways to remove edges, splitting the tree into subtrees on nodes:\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and [7] by removing the edge (3-7)\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7] and [5] by removing the edge (2-5)\n[2, 4, 5] and [1, 3, 6, 7] by removing the edge (1-2)\n[2, 4, 5], [1], [3,6] and [7] by removing edges (1-2), (1-3) and (3-7)\n[1, 2, 4], [5], [3,6] and [7] by removing edges (2-5), (1-3) and (3-7)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85stevens\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/XDCOMP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP on Trees\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2279\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\nYou are given an array of candies(Arr) of size N. The power of the Santa represents the sum of the values that you obtain after performing the described operations for N times.\nYour task is to delete the array by performing the following operations:\n\xe2\x88\x99\xe2\x80\xa2 For any turn(i) where (1 <= i <= N), delete either of the end (first or last) elements of remaining array.\n\xe2\x88\x99\xe2\x80\xa2 Before deleting that element (let's say at index K), it contributes to the sum of the values as Arr[K] x turn(i) + SV(i) the power of the array. Here, turn(i) represents the number of turns in which you are performing the operation\n\xe2\x88\x99\xe2\x80\xa2 SV(i) represents the value of the maximum element that is present in the remaining array before the ith turn is performed\nYou are required to perform this in such a way that you maximize the value of the power of the Santa.\nYou must print the maximum value of the power that can be obtained after the array is completely deleted.\nInput:\nFirst line contain N i.e length of Array\nSecond line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.  \nOutput:\nPrint in a new line the value that represents the maximum power that can be obtained after the array is completely deleted.\nConstraint:\n1 <= N <= 10^3\n1 <= Arr(i) <= 10^9\nSample Input:\n5\n5 4 3 6 2\nSample Output:\n96  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85avishake_maji\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SANPOWER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 avishake_maji, c-plus-plus, dynamic-programming, hard, jc22020\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

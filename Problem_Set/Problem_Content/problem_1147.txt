b'\nMr. Joy is a famous teacher in ZDC. He is a professor of Mathematics. As a very funny and good teacher, He is respected and loved by all the students. He is very famous for some dialogues he gives in the class. Students get a lot of fun with that and used to repeat these dialogues. Such as whenever he enters the classroom, all students stand up then he says \xe2\x80\x9cBose porii\xe2\x80\x9d. When he wants to remove a root from the equation while doing math, he used to say \xe2\x80\x9croot dekhle amader voy lage\xe2\x80\x9d. All the students repeat his words funnily.\nOne day the microphone fell from his hand while giving lecture . He then very funnily said \xe2\x80\x9cporeee gelooo\xe2\x80\x9d. Students got a lot of fun at this. They started repeating sir\xe2\x80\x99s words but with a little change. They removed the first character from the first word and put another one or more character into it. And as you know the students of ZDC are very ruled. So they chose characters in a serial. More clearly, they chose the word according to their roll number. Such as the student whose roll number is 1 used \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cp\xe2\x80\x9d in the sentence \xe2\x80\x9cporeee gelooo\xe2\x80\x9d and said \xe2\x80\x9caoreee gelooo\xe2\x80\x9d. similarly the student whose roll is 11, will say \xe2\x80\x9ckoreee gelooo\xe2\x80\x9d. And the students also like uniqueness. So none of the words will be repeated by anybody. Father Proshanto sir, was passing by the class, heard student\xe2\x80\x99s making noise. He seized some student and he heard what they are saying. But they are not telling their roll number when they were asked. Can you help father Proshanto sir to get their roll number?\nN. B. May one of the student repeat sir\xe2\x80\x99s dialogue bt none of them will repeat any other student\xe2\x80\x99s dialogue.\nN.B. the student with the roll 53 will say \xe2\x80\x9cbaoreee gelooo\xe2\x80\x9d .\nInput:\nThere are several test cases. The first line of the input starts with an integer TT. The next TT line contains a sentence consisting of lowercase latin letters (\xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x98z\xe2\x80\xb2)(\xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x98z\xe2\x80\xb2) only.\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer NN which denotes the roll no. of the following student. It is assured that the roll of the last boy of the class is 10^9.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSample Input:\n4\nkoreee gelooo\ndoreee gelooo\nmoreee gelooo\nadoreee gelooo\n\nSample Output:\n11\n4\n13\n30\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85aref111n\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PREGLO\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aref111n, easy, math, newb2020, strings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-09-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

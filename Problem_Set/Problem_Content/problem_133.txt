The deadline to submit the manuscript is within a couple of hours and Chef Tobby needs to finish the experiments before then.\nThe code given by Bhuvan is the following which runs given an array of N integers and another integer K :\n\n\nvoid recurse ( array a, int n )\n{\n\t// n = size of array\n\tdefine array b currently empty\n\tconsider all 2^n subsets of a[]\n\t{\n\t\tx = bitwise OR of elements in the subsets\n\t\tadd x into "b" if it is not present yet\n\t}\n\tif (sizeof( b ) == 1 << k)\n\t{\n\t\tprintf(\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x9d);\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\trecurse ( b, sizeof( b ) );\n}\n\n\n\nChef Tobby tried to run an experiment with only one integer in the array with value 2 and K = 3. To his horror, he found out that the algorithm is resulting in an infinite loop. He is livid with the possibility that the algorithm can lead to infinite loops for certain cases. On closer inspection he determines that it might be possible to insert additional elements in the initial array to subvert the problem. Since time is very less, Chef Tobby would like to insert the minimum number of elements.\nChef Tobby has to finish writing the paper, so he asks his graduate student Leamas to fix it. Leamas has no idea how to fix the problem so he asks you for help.\nInput section\nThe first line contains T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of 2 lines. The first line contains 2 integers N and K, denoting the number of elements in the array and parameter mentioned in problem statement.\nNext line contains N space separated integers, denoting the elements of the array.\nOutput section\nOutput the minimum number of elements that need to be inserted so that inifinite loop can be avoided.\nInput constraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 2K-1, where A[i] denotes the ith element of the array.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2 2\n3 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nYou can win the game by inserting the element 2 into the array.\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n7 3\n3 7 5 4 6 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nThe initial array will result will terminate in the first step of algorithm only. Thus there is no need to insert any new element.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85likecs\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LIKECS03\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Bitwise Operation, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2046\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-09-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

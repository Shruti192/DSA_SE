b"\nYou need to find the distance from the given piecewise-constant function to the set of all functions, satisfying Lipschitz condition with the constant K, in the space L1(\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9e, +\xe2\x88\x9e). If you understand nothing here then read the problem statement below :P\nChef Ciel and her friends go to karaoke after the New Year's party. In karaoke, they sing songs, and moreover, recent karaoke machines can score their performance. To get a high score, one of the most important things is to sing with correct pitches.\nThe correct pitch at time t for some song is represented as f(t), where f(t) is a piecewise-constant function. In this problem, let us consider the infinitely long time \xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9e < t < +\xe2\x88\x9e for simplicity. Let N\xe2\x88\x921 integers A1 < A2 < ... < AN\xe2\x88\x921 denote the time moments when the correct pitch is changed. That is,\n\nf(t) = B0, for \xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9e < t < A1,\nf(t) = Bk, for Ak \xe2\x89\xa4 t < Ak+1 (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 N\xe2\x88\x922),\nf(t) = BN\xe2\x88\x921, for AN\xe2\x88\x921 \xe2\x89\xa4 t < +\xe2\x88\x9e.\nOn the other hand, Ciel cannot change her pitch instantly. So Ciel's pitch g(t) must satisfy the condition |g(x) \xe2\x88\x92 g(y)| \xe2\x89\xa4 K |x \xe2\x88\x92 y| for all real x and y. In particular g(t) is a continuous function and |g'(t)| \xe2\x89\xa4 K for all t where g'(t) exists (g'(t) denotes the derivative of g(t)).\nThe score assigned to Ciel by the karaoke machine is the value of the integral of |f(t) \xe2\x88\x92 g(t)| over the interval (\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9e, +\xe2\x88\x9e). Your task is to calculate the minimum value of this integral over all possible functions g(t) that satisfy the above condition.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of exactly 3 lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K. The second line contains N\xe2\x88\x921 space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN\xe2\x88\x921. Finally, the third line contains N space separated integers B0, B1, ..., BN\xe2\x88\x921.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum value of the integral mentioned in the problem statement. The output must have an absolute or relative error at most 0.000001 (10\xe2\x88\x926). Please, note that your output should not have more than 1000 digits after the decimal point, otherwise you may (or may not) get wrong answer or runtime error (SIGXFSZ).\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 250\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 8\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 4\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 A1 < A2 < ... < AN\xe2\x88\x921 \xe2\x89\xa4 20130120\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 B0, B1, ..., BN\xe2\x88\x921 \xe2\x89\xa4 20130120\nIt can occur that Bi\xe2\x88\x921 = Bi for some i = 1, 2, ..., N\xe2\x88\x921\nThe sum of N3 in one test file does not exceed 2013\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 1\n1000\n900 1000\n2 2\n1000\n900 1000\n3 1\n500 1200\n20 60 30\n\nOutput:\n2500.0000000000\n1250.0000000000\n625.0000000000\nExplanation\nThe following figure corresponds to the example case 1.

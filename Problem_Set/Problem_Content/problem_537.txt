b"\n\xc2\xa0\nFluffy the Squirrel is playing a game based on his friend Flippy the Bird. The game is called Flippy Bird. Initially, Flippy will be standing on the number 0 on the number line. Then, Fluffy can perform n moves. For each move i, Fluffy can choose a direction, left or right. Then, Flippy will move in that direction for ai seconds. (and he travels 1 unit every second) Fluffy wins if Flippy's final position is between l and r inclusive. There are 2n possible ways to choose the directions for all n moves. Fluffy wants to know how many ways are there for him to win. Can you help him?\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of moves Fluffy will make. The next line contains n space-seperated integers, where the i-th integer denotes ai. The next line contains two space-seperated integers l, r\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOutput a single integer, the number of ways Fluffy can win. Output the answer modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of all ai \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n-100000 \xe2\x89\xa4 l \xe2\x89\xa4 r \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (33 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 20\nSubtask 2 (67 points) : Original Constraints\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 4 1\n-1 1\n\nOutput:\n2\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case.

Currently, he has to design a network that connects NN computers (numbered 11 through NN).\nThe network should consist of these NN computers and exactly MM cables. Usually, a cable needs to connect two different computers, but Chef is okay with connecting computers to themselves too. Therefore, let's describe a cable by the pair of computers (u,v)(u,v) it connects, where 1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4N. However, for each valid pair of computers (u,v)(u,v), there must be at most one cable that directly connects this pair of computers.\nLet's define the data consumption factor of a computer as the number of computers which are directly connected to it. In particular, if a computer vv is directly connected to itself (by a cable (v,v)(v,v)), it is only counted as connected to itself once. The data consumption factor of the whole network is the maximum of data consumption factors of all computers.\nIn the resulting network, each computer needs to be connected (directly or indirectly) to all other computers, so that they could communicate with each other.\nDetermine whether it is possible to design such a network. If it is possible, find the minimum possible data consumption factor of the resulting network.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum data consumption factor or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if Chef cannot design a required network.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa410150\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41015\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41030\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\nSubtask #2 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41021\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4102\nSubtask #3 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask #4 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 3\n5 6\n3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The optimal configuration (and the only configuration) of computers is to connect computers 11 and 22, connect computer 11 to itself and computer 22 to itself. Then, the consumption factor of each computer is 22 because it is directly connected to itself and the other computer.\nExample case 3: Here, the cables can connect pairs of computers (1,2)(1,2), (1,3)(1,3) and (2,3)(2,3). The consumption factor of each computer is 22. There is a configuration with consumption factor 11, where each computer is connected to itself, but all the computers are not connected, so this network configuration is invalid.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85admin5\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFK1\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graphs, Basic Maths, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1945\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

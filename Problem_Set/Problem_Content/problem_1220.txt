b'\nYou want to propose a girl named Cecile, but she is not a fool, she wants an intelligent boyfriend. So, she asks you to solve a problem in order to be her boyfriend.\nYou are given an array (Indexing starts from 1) consisting of NN numbers and you are asked MM queries of two types. The following are the two types of queries.\n11 XX YY \xe2\x88\xb6-Change the element of the array at position XX to YY.\n22 LL RR \xe2\x88\xb6- If dd = product of numbers of the array from index LL to RR(included both LL and RR), then Print the total count of numbers (1\xe2\x89\xa4number\xe2\x89\xa4d)(1\xe2\x89\xa4number\xe2\x89\xa4d) whose GCDGCD with dd is 11. As the count will be large so print the count modulo 109+7109+7 .\nNote: The number of different prime factors of all the numbers in the array at any instant will be less than or equal to 1010.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line consists of two integers NN, MM  separated by a space.\nSecond-line consists of NN integers of the array separated by space.\nNext, MM lines contains the MM queries, each query contains 33 integers TT AA BB separated by space, where TT= type of queries and AA and BB are the required numbers according to the query.\n\nOutput:\nFor each query of type 22, print the required answer in a new line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Y\xe2\x89\xa410000001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Y\xe2\x89\xa41000000 ,where 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N, AiAi  is the ithith  element of the array.\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L,R,X\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4L,R,X\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input:\n6 3\n3 6 9 10 2 5\n2 5 6\n1 2 1\n2 1 2\n\nSample Output:\n4\n2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor the first query, the product of array element from index 55 to 66 is 1010 and there are a total of 44 positive numbers less than or equal to 1010 whose gcd with 1010 is 11. they are {1,3,7,9}.\nFor the second query, the array element at index 2 changed, so the new array will be  A=[3,1,9,10,2,5].\nAnd again for  3rd3rd query, the product of array element from index 11 to 22 is 33 and there are a total of 22 positive numbers less than or equal to 33 whose gcd with 33 is 11. they are {1,2}.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85adikr_singh\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WINIT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 adikr_singh, data-structure, inro2021, math, medium-hard, number-theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

These cities are numbered 11 through NN and connected by MM bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.\nInitially, Ryan is in city 11. At each of the following KK seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has QQ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(aQ,bQ)(a1,b1),(a2,b2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(aQ,bQ) meaning that during this KK-second trip, for each valid ii, he wants to be in city aiai after exactly bibi seconds.\nSince you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7109+7. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,K1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,K seconds.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and KK.\nEach of the next MM lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting a road between cities uu and vv.\nThe next line contains a single integer QQ.\nQQ lines follow. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Q1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Q), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers aiai and bibi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,K,Q\xe2\x89\xa49,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,K,Q\xe2\x89\xa49,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\nui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi for each valid ii\nthere is at most one road between each pair of cities\neach city is reachable from every other city\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\n0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4K0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4K for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 9,0009,000\nthe sum of KK over all test cases does not exceed 9,0009,000\nthe sum of MM over all test cases does not exceed 9,0009,000\nthe sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 9,0009,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 400400\nthe sum of KK over all test cases does not exceed 400400\nthe sum of MM over all test cases does not exceed 400400\nthe sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 400400\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4 3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n0\n4 3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1\n2 2\n4 3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1\n2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n28\n4\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85watcher\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WNDR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Graph Algos\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2526\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

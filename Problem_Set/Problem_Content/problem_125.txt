b"\nTyler is back! This time with a bang. He has started taking Project Mayhem very seriously. Also, he has now become a professional hacker, but in his path of achieving technical excellence, he has become selfish, but that\xe2\x80\x99s cool. His goals are pretty clear, erase all of his credit history from all the banks in a particular state, and live a lavish life with his girlfriend Marla in that state.\nHe is finding a suitable state to live in, such that all the banks in that state don\xe2\x80\x99t have any of his credit history. It is very easy for him to clear the bank records, but very difficult to find a soft target.\nThe country is in the form of an N\xc3\x97MN\xc3\x97M grid, and each state contains a number of banks. Also, there is a concept of strength for each state's banks, lower is the strength of a bank, easier it is to hack it. All banks in a state have the same strength. Two banks with the same strength are said to be in the same state if and only if they are side adjacent to each other.\nNow, Tyler wants to live in a state where he can get the maximum number of banks. Also, he would prefer to have low strength for each bank in that state. Help him out with his problem and make Project Mayhem a success.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.\nEach of the next NN lines contain MM space-separated integers denoting the strength for each bank in the country.\n\nOutput:\nPrint two space-separated integers, denoting the strength of each bank and the number of banks in the chosen state.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4strength\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4strength\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points: 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa410\n70 points: original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n5 5\n1 1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2 2\n3 3 3 3 3\n4 4 4 4 4\n5 5 5 5 5\n\nSample Output:\n1 5\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ankushkhanna\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MARLA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ankushkhanna, ankushkhanna, breadth-first-search, cobe2019, depth-first-search, easy, graphs, greedy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

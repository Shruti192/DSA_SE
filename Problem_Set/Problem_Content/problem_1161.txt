b'\n\xc2\xa0\nIn a school there are N student .On the occation of annual function for each Si\nwhere 1<=i<=N student givent Ti tasks and difference between tasks of two consecutive students are same and (i+1)the student must get more task than ith student.\nSchool have M number of task. Your task is find out whether task distribution is possible or impossible.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\n The first line contains two integers N number sudent in school\nand M Total Number of task\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line "possible" distribution is possible otherwise "impossible".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 <= N <= 100\n1 <= M <= 10000\n1 <= Difference Between tasks of two consecutive student  <= 100\n1 <= Max Number of Task Given to First student <= 100\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:#1\n5 15\nOutput:\npossible\n\xc2\xa0\nInput:#2\n4 8\nOutput:\nimpossible\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\n\nIn the first test case N is 5 and M is 5. The possible distribution is 1 2 3 4 5.\nhere the different between task of two consecutive student is 1;\nIn the second test case N is 4 and M is 8.The minimum task reqired to disribute between students 10 i.e.\n is 1,2,3,4. So distribution of task is impossible.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsintuuemisp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/UEMP02\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 math, processing, sintuuemisp\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-07-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, TEXT, JS\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

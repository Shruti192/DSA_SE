b'\nChef and Chefina are playing a game. Chef is very good in Maths subject. He can quickly calculate the value of any equation given to him. On the other hand Chefina is good at remembering things. She can remember sequences or series of any length. In the game they decided to ask a question to each other, and the one who could not answer the question will lose. Chefina has already answered the Chef\xe2\x80\x99s question and now it\xe2\x80\x99s her turn to ask the question and Chef will answer it. The question asked by the Chefina is :\nThere is a Sequence SS. She will give its first term XX, second term YY and third term ZZ. The nthnth term of the sequence is the sum of the previous three terms. Formally Sn=S(n\xe2\x88\x921)+S(n\xe2\x88\x922)+S(n\xe2\x88\x923)Sn=S(n\xe2\x88\x921)+S(n\xe2\x88\x922)+S(n\xe2\x88\x923). Then she will ask TT queries. In each query she will give an integer NN to Chef and Chef has to tell the NthNth element of the sequence. Chef found this question very easy and thought he would answer quickly. But after looking at the constraints of TT and NN, he got confused and asked for your help. Are you able to find the answer i.e. NthNth term of the given sequence.\nNote\xe2\x88\x92Note\xe2\x88\x92 As you can see size of the elements of sequence can be very large, so for every NthNth term take modulo 10000000071000000007 .\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain four integers TT, XX, YY, ZZ number of testcases, first term, second term, third term respectively. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer NN.  \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single  number , the NthNth term of the sequence.  \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y,Z\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y,Z\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample Input:\n3 1 3 4\n3\n5\n6  \nSample Output:\n4\n15\n27   \nEXPLANATION:\nCase\xc2\xa0#1Case\xc2\xa0#1 : The sequence will be 1,3,4,8,15,27,50. We are asked to find 3rd term, which is 4.  \nCase\xc2\xa0#2Case\xc2\xa0#2 : The sequence will remain same here i.e. 1,3,4,8,15,27,50. 5th term is 15.    \nCase\xc2\xa0#3Case\xc2\xa0#3 : Again sequence will be same for third query also. And 6th term of the sequence is 27.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85prasoonjain006\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFSQN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 heat2021, math, prasoonjain006\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

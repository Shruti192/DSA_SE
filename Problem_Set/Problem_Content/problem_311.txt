b"\n\xc2\xa0\n\nUnder the Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan, Afzal decides to clean a park covered with garbage and leaves with a battery operated vacuum cleaner. The park is a 2 dimensional space with roads occupying some of its squares, such as the one shown in the figure below. The naming conventions are Cartesian with the origin square being named as (0,0). Afzal needs to clean the park with the following constraints: -\n\n\n\nHe has t minutes of time in which he can clean as much as possible.\nHe has a vacuum cleaner which is fully charged with c units.\nThere is only one charging point in the park which is at this starting square, say (x,y).\nCleaning each square consumes 40 units of charge and 5 minutes of time.\nMoving from one square to its adjacent requires no units of charge and 2 minutes of time.\nIf the charge left in the vacuum cleaner is less than 40, the square cannot be cleaned. In this case, he will have to back to his starting point for charging and the time required for charging is 20 minutes.\nAfzal can move his cleaner only on the roads of the park.\n\nYou need to find out the maximum number of squares that can be cleaned in this time interval.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line of input will contain a single integer n denoting number of squares filled by the roads.\nThe second line will contain the integer t denoting total available time.\nThe third line will contain the integer c denoting the total charge.\nThe fourth line will contain the co-ordinates of the start square in the form 'i j' which refers to the (i,j)th square.\nThe next n lines will contain the co-ordinates of the squares in the form 'i j' which refers to the (i,j)th square.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput will contain a single integer denoting the number of squares cleaned.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 c \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nMaximum area of the park will be 256 x 256.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n34\n70\n100\n5 0\n0 5\n1 5\n2 5\n3 5\n4 5\n5 5\n6 5\n7 5\n8 5\n8 6\n8 4\n8 3\n8 2\n9 2\n10 2\n5 0\n5 1\n5 2\n5 3\n5 4\n5 6\n5 7\n5 8\n2 2\n2 3\n2 4\n2 6\n2 7\n2 8\n2 9\n2 10\n3 10\n4 10\n5 10\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\n4\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nThe example is same as the image shown above.\nAt t=0, he is at (5,0).\nAt t=5, he cleans (5,0), rem. charge is 60.\nAt t=6, he is at (5,1).\nAt t=11, he cleans (5,1), rem. charge is 20.\nAt t=12, he is again at (5,0) to charge.\nAt t=32, he completes charging.\nAt t=34, he is at (5,2).\nAt t=39, he cleans (5,2), rem. charge is 60.\nAt t=45, he cleans (5,3), rem. charge is 20.\nAt t=48, he is at the starting pt. (5,0) for charging.\nAt t=68, charging gets complete.\nHowever, only 2 minutes are remaining and no square can be cleaned now; hence, the output, 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nabhirajphadnis\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRINDIA3\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 abhirajphadnis, graphs, greedy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-10-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

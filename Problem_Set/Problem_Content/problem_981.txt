b"\nChef's professor is planning to give his class a group assignment. There are 2N2N students in the class, with distinct roll numbers ranging from 11 to 2N2N. Chef's roll number is XX.\nThe professor decided to create NN groups of 22 students each. The groups were created as follows: the first group consists of roll numbers 11 and 2N2N, the second group of roll numbers 22 and 2N\xe2\x88\x9212N\xe2\x88\x921, and so on, with the final group consisting of roll numbers NN and N+1N+1.\nChef wonders who his partner will be. Can you help Chef by telling him the roll number of his partner?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer TT \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers NN and XX, denoting the number of groups that will be formed, and Chef's roll number. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the roll number of the student that will be Chef's partner.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4108\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa42N1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa42N\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 2\n3 1\n3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n6\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: The groups will be {(1,4),(2,3)}{(1,4),(2,3)}. Chef's roll number is 22, so his partner's roll number will be 33.\nTest case 22: The groups will be {(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)}{(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)}. Chef's roll number is 11, so his partner's roll number will be 66.\nTest case 33: The groups will be {(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)}{(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)}. Chef's roll number is 44, so his partner's roll number will be 33.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nutkarsh_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GROUPASSGN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, math, start31, utkarsh_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n872\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

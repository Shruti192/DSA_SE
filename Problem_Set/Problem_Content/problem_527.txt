b'\n"We\xe2\x80\x99ve already come too far to end this now".\nNN players advance to the fifth round and the game is going to be Hopscotch. Every player has to select one mannequin before the start of the game.\nPlayers are numbered 11 to NN. You are given an array AA of size NN, where    \n\nIf Ai=iAi=i, the ithith player selects their own mannequin.\nIf Ai=jAi=j where j\xe2\x89\xa0ij\xe2\x89\xa0i, the ithith player decides the mannequin for the jthjth player.\nIf Ai=0Ai=0, the ithith player hasn\xe2\x80\x99t decided yet.\n\nThe VIPs want to know the number of ways that the undecided players can select mannequins such that everyone gets a mannequin, and no undecided players select their own mannequin.\nIt is guaranteed that every (non-zero) element in AA is unique, i.e, if 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N are such that i\xe2\x89\xa0j,Ai>0i\xe2\x89\xa0j,Ai>0, and Aj>0Aj>0, then Ai\xe2\x89\xa0AjAi\xe2\x89\xa0Aj.\nSince the answer can be very large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the number of players.    \nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers, the ithith of which is AiAi as described in the statement above.\n\nOutput Format\nFor every test case, print one line containing the number of ways undecided players can select mannequins for others such that everyone receives a mannequin, modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N\nThe non-zero elements of AA are distinct.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3    \n5    \n1 2 3 4 5    \n6    \n3 6 1 0 0 0    \n10    \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0    \n3    \n1334961\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: There is no undecided player, so the number of ways is 00.\nTest Case 2: There are 33 ways for the last 33 players to decide mannequins, all of which are listed below:\n\n4\xe2\x86\x922,5\xe2\x86\x924,6\xe2\x86\x9254\xe2\x86\x922,5\xe2\x86\x924,6\xe2\x86\x925\n4\xe2\x86\x925,5\xe2\x86\x924,6\xe2\x86\x9224\xe2\x86\x925,5\xe2\x86\x924,6\xe2\x86\x922\n4\xe2\x86\x925,5\xe2\x86\x922,6\xe2\x86\x9244\xe2\x86\x925,5\xe2\x86\x922,6\xe2\x86\x924\n\nwhere a\xe2\x86\x92ba\xe2\x86\x92b means that aa selects the mannequin for bb.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85still_me\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GIFTPAIRS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics, Derangements, Inclusion Exclusion Principle, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Set Theory, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2568\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

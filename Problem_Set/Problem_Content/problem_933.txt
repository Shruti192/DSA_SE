He ordered NN apples, where NN is a multiple of KK. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. \nOnly two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put KK apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts KK apples in it.\nChef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?\nNote: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the final distributions of apples can be different or "NO" if they will be the same (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4250\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41018\nNN is divisible by KK\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 1\n4 2\n10 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.\nExample case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.\nExample case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be 1010 apples in one box and none in all other boxes.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85y__y\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DSTAPLS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1374\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-07-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

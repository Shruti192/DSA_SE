b'\n Read problems statements in Russian here\nChef\'s Girl Friend has given him a unique gift. She has given him a string S. Chef being a gentleman wants to return her gift in a unique way. He wants to break the string he has received into some number of substrings so that each substring is a palindrome. However he does not want break the string into too many substrings, otherwise the average size of his strings will become small. What is the minimum number of substrings in which the given string can be broken so that each substring is a palindrome.\nTips: \nRefer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome for the definition of a "palindrome" \nInput\nInput description.\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows:\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of alphabets in the given string. The second line contains the given string. \nOutput\nFor each test case output a single integer the answer to the given test case. Print answer for each test case on a separate line. \nConstraints\nAll characters in the given string are upper case English alphabets.\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\n Scoring \n  Subtask 1: (15 points):\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n  Subtask 2: (25 points):\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 250\n  Subtask 1: (60 points):\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 \n7\nABCCBDA\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The given string can be broken into "A" , "BCCB" , "D" , "A". It can be verified that you can\'t break the given string into less than 4 substrings such that each substring in a palindrome.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nvineet_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHGLSTGT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1986\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-10-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\nYou've got an MCQ Assignment sheet of Descriptive Statistics to finish before tomorrow morning. the sheet only includes only 1 type of Question but with Different data fields in each question.\n\nQuestion - Distance of top of bars from X-axis is given to you. Plot the Graph for given data\n   and find the Volume of Graph that can be filled with any fluid.\n\nYou don't want to do the same calculation so many times since you're short on time. So you decide to write an algorithm that calculates the Volume of a graph. \nNote - Assume an elevetion Graph where width of each bar is 1.\n Now go write the Algorithm and help yourself.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe description of T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N i.e. number of walls.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers D1,D2\xe2\x80\xa6DN height of each wall.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer\n\xe2\x80\x95 the volume of water that  could be hold in tank.\nConstraints\n1 <= T <= 100\n1 <= N <= 100\n1 <= Di <= 10^5    \nSample Input\n2\n15\n1 3 2 4 1 3 1 4 5 2 2 1 4 2 2\n12\n0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1  \nSample Output\n15\n6  \nExplanation\nSample 1 :\n1+3+1+3+2+2+3 = 15 units on bars {3,5,6,7,10,11,12} respectively.  \n \nSample 2 :\n1+1+4+1+1 = 6  units on bars {3,5,6,7,10} respectively ( on 1 unit Scale ).  \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85rnkjoshi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INNOV105\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 compression, difficult, dijkstra-algorithm, dynamic-programming, inno2020, rnkjoshi, strings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-09-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nDevu has an array A consisting of N positive integers. He would like to perform following operation on array.\nPick some two elements a, b in the array (a could be same as b, but their corresponding indices in the array should not be same).\nRemove both the elements a and b and instead add a number x such that x lies between min(a, b) and max(a, b), both inclusive, (i.e. min(a, b) \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 max(a, b)).\n\nNow, as you know after applying the above operation N - 1 times, Devu will end up with a single number in the array. He is wondering whether it is possible to do the operations in such a way that he ends up a number t. \n\n\nHe asks your help in answering Q such queries, each of them will contain an integer t and you have to tell whether it is possible to end up t. \n\nInput\nThere is only one test case per test file.\nFirst line of the input contains two space separated integers N, Q denoting number of elements in A and number of queries for which Devu asks your help, respectively\nSecond line contains N space separated integers denoting the content of array A.\nEach of the next Q lines, will contain a single integer t corresponding to the query.\nOutput\nOutput Q lines, each containing "Yes" or "No" (both without quotes) corresponding to the answer of corresponding query.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 t \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 : 30 points\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 2\n\nSubtask #2 : 70 points\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example, Devu can\'t apply any operation. So the final element in the array will be 1 itself. \n\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 4\n1 3\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the second example,\nDevu can replace 1 and 3 with any of the numbers among 1, 2, 3. Hence final element of the array could be 1, 2 or 3. \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DEVARRAY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1126\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-05-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

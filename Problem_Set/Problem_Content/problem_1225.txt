b'\nYou are given two integers AA and BB, in which one of them is guaranteed to be equal to 2.\nWith AA and BB, you are allowed to create any number XX which can be expressed as M\xe2\x88\x97A+N\xe2\x88\x97BM\xe2\x88\x97A+N\xe2\x88\x97B for any non-negative integers MM and NN.\nFind out the number of natural numbers which cannot be expressed as stated above. If there are infinite of them then print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\nInput:\n\nFirst and only line will contain two space separated integers AA and BB, of which at-least one is guaranteed to be equal to 22.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the number of natural numbers that cannot be expressed as stated in the problem statement, if there are infinite of them then print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n\nSample Input:\n2 7\n\nSample Output:\n3\n\nEXPLANATION:\nNumbers 1,3,5 cannot be expressed as previously stated.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85murugappan_s\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TWOFUN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ccpc2019, easy, math, murugappan_s\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-06-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

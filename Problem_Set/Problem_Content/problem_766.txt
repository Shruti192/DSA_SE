b'\nYou are given two strings AA and BB. The string AA consists of lowercase English alphabets and the string BB can consist of lowercase English alphabets as well as special power characters. There are three types of special power characters: #, ? and !. Each of these special power characters are associated with a few lowercase English alphabets. You can either just remove the special power character from any position, or the special power character can be replaced with any string of your choice, but with the condition that the string must not include any character which is not among the characters associated with that special power character.\nYou have to tell the minimum number of distinct special power characters used to convert BB to AA. If not possible print -1.\nFor eg. if the string BB is ab?f#z?d and ? is associated with asev and # is associated with abr. Then you can transform BB into absvvafrrrzed by replacing the ? at position 3 by svva, replacing # at position 5 by rrr and replacing ? at position 7 by e. Similarly, the string B can be transformed into abfbbbaabazeeeeed by removing the ? at position 3, replacing # at position 5 with bbbaaba and replacing ? at position 7 by eeeee. The string B can also be converted into abfzd by removing all the three special power characters. There are infinite possible tranformation of the string B. Now, if AA is abfbbazd, then BB can be transfomed into AA by removing the ? at position 3, replacing # with bba and removing the ? at position 7. Therefore, we used only one distinct special power character i.e. #. You cannot tranform the string BB to AA using 0 distinct special power character, therefore the answer is 1.\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains the TT, the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains the string AA.\nThe second line of each testcase contains the string BB.\nThe next three lines of each testcase contain three strings, the associated lowercase English alphabets for #, ? and ! respectively.\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint in a single line the minimum  number of distinct special power characters used to convert BB to AA. If not possible print -1.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa41\xe2\x89\xa4 length of A,B\xe2\x89\xa4600A,B\xe2\x89\xa4600\nThe associated characters with each #, ? and ! are distinct lowercase English alphabets.\ni.e. 1\xe2\x89\xa41\xe2\x89\xa4 length of associated characters with #, ? and ! \xe2\x89\xa426\xe2\x89\xa426.\n\nSample Input 1:\n2\nabfbbazd\nab?f#z?d\nabr\nasev\nyhsc\nbgghdffgzzz\nb#!hd?#g!#z?\nagezfh\nflk\nizogt\n\nSample Output:\n1\n1\n\nExplanations:\nTestcase 1: Already explained in the problem statement.\nTestcase 2: There are more than one ways to convert the string BB to AA. But to minimize the distinct number of special power characters used, we can replace the first # with gg, the second # with ff and the last # with zz, and remove all the ? and !. Therefore, we used only one distinct special power character i.e. #.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dj_r_1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SPPSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-07-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

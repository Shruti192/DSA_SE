b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has recently learned robotics and has now been able to construct a robot that\'s much better than his robots from last year. It\'s still somewhat limited, but it\'s definitely more flexible than before. Here are its properties:\n\n\nThe robot can only move forward towards the direction it faces, and can only face either horizontally or vertically.\nThe robot can only turn at 90 degree angles.\nThe robot is designed to turn exactly N times.\n\n\nIn addition, this robot is programmable. You can feed it 2N+1 values: a0, f1, a1, f2, a2, ..., fN, aN, where each ai is a positive integer and each fi is either L or R, and then it will perform the following actions:\n\nInitially face north.\nMove forward by a0 steps.\nIf f1 is L, turn left 90 degrees; if f1 is R, turn right 90 degrees.\nMove forward by a1 steps.\nIf f2 is L, turn left 90 degrees; if f2 is R, turn right 90 degrees.\nMove forward by a2 steps.\n...\nIf fN is L, turn left 90 degrees; if fN is R, turn right 90 degrees.\nMove forward by aN steps.\n\nNow, Chef wants to test his new robot. Chef has already prepared the 2N+1 values to feed to the robot. However, Chef is very lazy and doesn\'t want to move, so he wants the robot to return to its starting point exactly. To do so, he can change some of the values, but some changes need time. Specifically,\n\nChef can increase or decrease any ai by 1, but this takes 1 second. Also, this change is only allowed if the new ai value is positive.\nChef can replace any fi by L or R. This takes 0 seconds.\n\nNow, Chef wants to know the minimum number of seconds he needs to accomplish this task. Since Chef is lazy, he asks you to solve this problem for him.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N. The second line contains 2N+1 space-separated values a0, f1, a1, f2, a2, ..., fN, aN.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a line containing a single integer, the minimum number of seconds he needs to accomplish the task. If it is impossible to perform the task, output "NO" (without quotes) instead.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, ai \xe2\x89\xa4 500\nfi is either L or R\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3\n11 L 7 L 11 R 7\n3\n11 L 9 L 11 R 7\n\nOutput:\n0\n2\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Chef can replace f3 by L, which takes 0 seconds, so that the robot goes back to its starting position. Chef can also replace f1 and f2 by R instead, which also takes 0 + 0 = 0 seconds.\nExample case 2. Chef can decrease a1 twice and then replace f3 by L, which takes 2 + 0 = 2 seconds, so that the robot goes back to its starting position. It can be shown that this is the minimum number of seconds Chef needs to accomplish this task.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RWALK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy, kevinsogo, snckel16\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-05-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\n\xc2\xa0\nShivam and Sameer are roommates.Shivam used to do crazy things.He is upset with Sameer because Sameer was absent on his birthday.Shivam has a rope with a finite length "L".He makes an rectangular area around his bed with the rope and ask Sameer to not came into this area . Shivam wants to occupy maximum space help him to find the length and breadth of the rectangle so that it can occupy maximum space.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains T i.e. the number of test cases.\n.\nT lines follow, each line containing an integer L,\n\nOutput\nPrint the length and the width of the rectangle upto two decimal of the maximum area in space seperated form in new line for each testcase .\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n1\n100\n\nOutput:\n25.00 25.00\n\n\nSolution#include<stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n\t\n    int t;\n\tscanf("%lld ",t);\n\twhile(t>0)\n\t{\n\t    int l,a,b;\n\t    a=l/4;\n\t\tscanf("%lld ",l);\n\t\tprintf("%d %d",a,b);\n\t}\n}\n\n\nSteps to be followed\n    1. Read the given description carefully and understand the problem.\n\n    2. Analyze the code given in the problem and find bugs(errors) in these codes..\n\n    3. The given code can be copied and compiled in an online compiler (Eg. ideone.com).\n\n    4. Once the bugs are eliminated from the code, the clean code can be submitted as the solution to the problem..\n\n    5. The solution should be a debugged version of the code provided and must satisfy the test cases to be accepted..\nAll the best!!\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85vipinkhushu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CULMYCA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cdwr2016, easy, math, vipinkhushu\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, PYPY\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

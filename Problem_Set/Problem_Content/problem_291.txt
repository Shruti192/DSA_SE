b'\nBob and Alice are very close friends. Once they decided to go to a shop to buy strings for themselves. The strings available in the shop contain only lowercase Latin letters. Alice and Bob decided to buy strings of the same length NN. They also wanted the strings to be equal.\nIt is guaranteed that the shop has at least two strings of the length NN. But it\'s not guaranteed that the shop has two equal strings. Hence, they decided to exchange characters among themselves to make the strings equal. Let the two strings they bought be represented by AA and BB. For all ii such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N21\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N2, they can perform the following operations on the strings any number of times: \n\nSwap AiAi with BiBi\nSwap AiAi with AN\xe2\x88\x92i+1AN\xe2\x88\x92i+1\n\nYou have to tell the minimum number of operations needed to make the strings equal. Or determine that it\'s impossible.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then TT the test cases follow. \nFirst line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nSecond line of each test case contains a single string AA.\nThrid line of each test case contains a single string BB.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line the required answer. If it not possible to make the strings equal, print "-1".\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|A|=|B|=N|A|=|B|=N\nStrings contain only lowercase Latin letters\n\nSample Input:\n2\n4\nwbbw\nrbbr\n1\nr\nz  \nSample Output:\n2\n-1  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85sibasish_14\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/THETRADE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ftcf2020, greedy, sibasish_14, sibasish_14, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

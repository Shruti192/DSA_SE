b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given an array A, consisting of N integers and an array B, consisting of M integers.\nThe subsequence of A is the array that can be obtained by picking the elements at the arbitrary sorted set of positions from A.\nYour task is to count the number of such subsequences C of A that:\n\nC contains exactly M elements.\nThe array (C+B) is non-decreasing. Here by + operation, we mean element-wise sum. \nFor example, the array (4, 8, 5) plus the array (10, 20, 30) is (14, 28, 35).\nFormally, (C+B) is an array of size M such that (C+B)i = Ci + Bi.\n\n\nIn case some subsequence appears more that once, you should counts it as many times as it appears.\nFormally, two subarrays of an array a, (ai_1, ai_2, ... ,ai_n) and (aj_1, aj_2, ... ,aj_m) will be considered different if either their lengths are different i.e. n != m or there exists an index k such that such that i_k  != j_k.\n\nSince the answer can be very large, we ask you to calculate it, modulo 109+7.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains a pair of space separated integers N and M, denoting the number of elements in the array A and the number of elements in the array B.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers Ai, denoting the array A.\nThe third line contains M space-separated integers Bj, denoting the array B.\nOutput\nOutput a single line containing the number of subsequences C as asked in the problem, modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai, Bi \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (33 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 5\nSubtask #2 (33 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 500, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nSubtask #3 (34 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2000, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\nExample\nInput #1:\n5 3\n1 5 2 4 7\n7 9 6\n\nOutput #1:\n4\n\nInput #2:\n4 2\n7 7 7 7\n3 4\n\nOutput #2:\n6\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The suitable subsequences are (1, 2, 7), (1, 4, 7), (5, 4, 7), (2, 4, 7).\nExample case 2. The suitable subsequence is (7, 7), and it appears 6 times:\n\nat indices (1, 2)\nat indices (1, 3)\nat indices (1, 4)\nat indices (2, 3)\nat indices (2, 4)\nat indices (3, 4)\n\n\nSo, the answer is 6.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85zedthirtyeight\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ARRAYSUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Data Structures, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Coordinate Compression, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Pre processing, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2530\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nA palindrome is a string that reads same in both directions: forwards and backwards. For example, the strings radar and noon are palindromes, whereas the string chef is not a palindrome as being read backwards is becomes equal to fehc, which is not equal to chef.\nLet\'s say that the pair of indices (i, j) denotes a palindrome in some string S iff i \xe2\x89\xa4 j and the substring starting at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character of S is a palindrome.\nGiven an integer N. Your task is to construct a string S such that there are exactly N different pairs (i, j) that denotes a palindrome.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the sought number of pairs that denote palindrome. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a string S, consisting of lowecase Latin letters, and having exactly N distinct palindrome-denoting pairs. If there\'s a few such strings, output any one.\nIf such string S doesn\'t exist, output -1 instead of it.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n6\n7\n2\n\nOutput:\nnoon\nradar\nab\nExplanation\nExample case 1. In the string "noon", the pairs that denote a palindrome are (1-indexed): (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4).\nExample case 2. In the string "radar", the pairs that denote a palindrome are (1-indexed): (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5).\nExample case 3. In the string "ab", the pairs denoting a palindrome are : (1, 1), (2, 2)\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NDIFFPAL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-05-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nTara was completing an Algorithms assignment and got stuck on a question. She thought of who can help her, and got reminded of Kabir who has good problem solving skills. The question is:\nGiven NN the number of elements in the sequence A1A1,A2A2 \xe2\x80\xa6 AnAn. Find out the prime factor which occurred maximum number of times among the largest prime factor corresponding to each element. if there are more than one such prime factors print the largest one.\nYou are friends with Kabir, help him to solve the problem for Tara.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \nFirst line of each test case contains NN, the number of elements in the sequence.\nSecond line contains N space separated elements A1A1,A2A2 \xe2\x80\xa6 AnAn.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, print a single line, the number which occurs maximum number of times from the largest prime factor corresponding to each element.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n1\n7\n\n3 2 15 6 8 5 10\nSample Output:\n5\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe largest prime factors of numbers are:\n3 2  5  3  2  5  5 , of which 5 is most frequent.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85muzare_ali\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CC005\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, hecs2020, math, muzare_ali, sieve, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-02-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

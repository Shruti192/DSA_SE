b"\nThe kingdom of Ererraveth has NN cities and N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 roads. A single road connects 2 cities. From any city it is possible to reach all other cities via the roads. It can be deduced that there is a unique path between any 2 cities. Each city is labeled with a unique number 11 to NN. The city where the royal palace is located is assigned number 11.\nThe evil prince Drach who was once banished is planning to return and claim the empire for himself. First, he will capture the royal palace. Next, he will have his revenge on the lords of the cities. To punish a city, he will simply destroy all roads that connect it to its neighbouring cities, and the city will slowly starve. \nHowever, there are KK cities whose lords have supported Drach in the past. Let's call these good cities. Drach will ensure that all good cities remain connected via roads to his royal palace. Thus any city which is not good but lies on the path from the royal palace to a good city will be spared. But if the lord of any good city is removed from his post by the time Drach is back, he will no longer consider it a good city.\nLet GG be the set of potentially good cities with |G|=K|G|=K, and G\xe2\x80\xb2G\xe2\x80\xb2 be a subset of GG. Drach wants to know the number of roads he will have to destroy if G\xe2\x80\xb2G\xe2\x80\xb2 be the set of good cities, i.e. if all cities in G\xe2\x80\xb2G\xe2\x80\xb2 remain connected to his palace in city 11 and all cities that are not essential for the above are punished. You will need to calculate the bitwise XOR-sum of the results for all the 2K2K possible subsets G\xe2\x80\xb2G\xe2\x80\xb2.\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains NN, the number of cities.\nN\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. Each line contains two integers uu and vv denoting that city uu and vv are connected via a road.\nThe next line contains KK, the number of potentially good cities \nThe next line contains the KK potentially good cities G1,G2,...GKG1,G2,...GK.\n\nOutput:\n\nOutput in a single line the XOR-sum of the number of roads Drach needs to destroy for each subset G\xe2\x80\xb2G\xe2\x80\xb2 of GG if G\xe2\x80\xb2G\xe2\x80\xb2 is considered the set of good cities.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(27,N\xe2\x88\x921)1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(27,N\xe2\x88\x921)\n2\xe2\x89\xa4Gi\xe2\x89\xa4N2\xe2\x89\xa4Gi\xe2\x89\xa4N\nAll GiGi are distinct\n\nSample Input:\n7\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 7\n2\n2 7\n\nSample Output:\n4\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor G\xe2\x80\xb2={}G\xe2\x80\xb2={}, 66 roads need to be destroyed.\nFor G\xe2\x80\xb2={2}G\xe2\x80\xb2={2}, 55 roads need to be destroyed.\nFor G\xe2\x80\xb2={7}G\xe2\x80\xb2={7}, 44 roads need to be destroyed.\nFor G\xe2\x80\xb2={2,7}G\xe2\x80\xb2={2,7}, 33 roads need to be destroyed.\nSo the answer is 6\xe2\x8a\x955\xe2\x8a\x954\xe2\x8a\x953=46\xe2\x8a\x955\xe2\x8a\x954\xe2\x8a\x953=4.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85meooow\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLERVT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, DP Bitmask, Bitmasking, Euler Tour\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2944\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-04-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\nThe F.R.I.E.N.D.S are very bored and sad as they cannot visit \xe2\x80\x98Central Perk\xe2\x80\x99  anymore and are stuck in their apartments. So, Joey and Chandler come up with a new game called \xe2\x80\x9cMaze Escape\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThis is how it works:\nThe Maze is in the form of a rectangular grid. where there are M+1M+1 levels numbered from 0\xe2\x88\x92M0\xe2\x88\x92M and each level has N+1N+1  doors numbered from 0\xe2\x88\x92N0\xe2\x88\x92N, all the doors lead to the same upper level.\n\nChandler is confident that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to add any traps to the maze and Joey is still going to fail to cross it(cause we all know how smart joey is).\nEach door of level  \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99 leads to the next level 'i+1' and it is possible to travel vertically at the current level without restrictions. \nBut this time Joey suspects some of the doors must be trapped. So he has formulated a plan to cross the Maze, his plan is an array of Integers CC, which tells him which possible doors he can choose at each level. At each level i where 1 <=i<=M C[i] denotes the absolute difference between his previous choice of the door (the door through which he entered the current level) and the current door that he can take. \n\nEg, if he took door 5 at level i-1, and C[i] is 4, then he must take either door number 5+4 = 9  or  5-4= 1, at this level. He can never go outside the grid.\nJoey always chooses his lucky number Jth Door when he enters the Maze at level 0.\nCount and print the number of doors from which Joey can possibly exit the Maze at the Mth level, or print -1 if it is impossible for Joey to exit given his current plan.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input contains NN and MM. \nThe second line of input contains a single integer JJ, Joey's lucky number.\nThe third line of input contains M integers of array C[] where  1<=i<=M, C[i] indicated the \nthe absolute difference of the door number Joey can take at level i and the door he took at level i-1.  \n\nOutput:\nA single integer indicating the number of possible doors Joey can exit level M or print -1 if it is impossible for Joey to exit the Maze following his plan.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4J\xe2\x89\xa4M0\xe2\x89\xa4J\xe2\x89\xa4M\n\nSample Input:\n    4 4\n    0\n    2 1 2 1\n\nSample Output:\n    3\n\nEXPLANATION:\nJoey enters the Maze at level  0 through door 0. \nAt level 1 C[1]= 2, So he can choose only door 2 to move to the next level.\nAt level 2 C[2]= 1, So he can choose door 3 or 1\nAt level 3 C[3]=2, He can choose door 1 or 3\nAt level 4 C[4]= 1, Similarly at level 4 he can pass through door 0,2 or 4 at level 4. \nSo the answer is 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85neha190301\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHAJOE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cote2020, dynamic-programming, easy, neha190301\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-04-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

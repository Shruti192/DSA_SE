b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has decided to start a new firm called PatentChef. However, he\'s stuck with some big legal issues. Their firm has received offers from a lot of companies, so Chef told his friend Junior Chef to look over some patent cases and solve them as quickly as he can.\nJunior Chef is very smart and has an eye for every little detail. He quickly found a case and went ahead to solve it. The patent case is as follows:\nThere are N patents to be filed for a company. Chef\xe2\x80\x99s firm has the first M months of the year 2018 to finish this task. (The months in a year are numbered 1 through 12.) Chef\'s firm has K workers (including Junior Chef) available to work on this case. Each worker can prepare exactly one patent per month.\nJunior Chef assigns work to workers starting from the first month of the year. He can have any workers work on this case on any month provided that they\'re chosen according to the following conditions:\n\nEach worker can only work on this patent case for at most one month.\nEach worker has to work either on an even month or an odd month of the year. You are given a string S with length K and the following meaning: for each valid i, if the i-th character of S is E, worker i has to work on an even month; if it\'s O, this worker has to work on an odd month.\nAt most X workers can work on this patent case each month.\n\nDetermine whether Chef\xe2\x80\x99s firm and Junior Chef can finish this patent case in time.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, M, X and K.\nThe second line contains a single string S.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if it\'s possible to finish the patent case or "no" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, K \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 12\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of K over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 107\n|S| = K\neach character of S is either E or O\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 12\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 4 2 4\nEEOO\n4 3 1 4\nEEOO\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nyes\nno\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The firm can prepare 2 patents per month, so in the first month (odd), workers 3 and 4 can work on 2 patents, and in the second month (even), workers 1 and 2 can work on the remaining 2 patents.\nExample case 2: There is no way for multiple workers to work on the same (even or odd) month. Hence, it\'s impossible to finish 4 patents in 3 months.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85nerdyninja\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85r_64\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFPTNT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arithmetic, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1517\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

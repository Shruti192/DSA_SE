b"\nAn exam consists of N questions. The marks of the N questions are m1, m2, m3, .. mN respectively.\nJam is giving the exam and he wants to maximise his number of marks.\nHowever he takes some time to solve each question. The time taken by him to solve the questions are t1, t2, t3, .. tN respectively.\nThe exams lasts for a total of time T.\nBut Jam's teacher is very smart and she knows that Jam will find out a way to get maximum marks. So, to confuse Jam, she also puts up a bonus offer for him -\nThe offer is that Jam can select a question for which he can double the marks awarded for that question.\nNow, Jam is indeed confused. Help him find out the maximum number of marks he can gain.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer N, that represents the number of questions.\nSecond line contains a single integer T, the total time for which the exam takes place.\nThird line contains N space-separated integers\nm1, m2, m3, ... mN, where mi represents marks assigned to the ith question.\nFourth line contains N space-separated integers\nt1, t2, t3, ... tN, where ti represents time taken to solve the ith question.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOutput a single integer, that is the maximum number of marks Jam can achieve.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n1<=N<=1000\n1<=T<=10000\n1<=mi<=100000\n1<=ti<=10000\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3\n10\n1 2 3\n4 3 4\n\nOutput:\n8\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85wittyceaser\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EXAM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, knapsack, ncc2014, wittyceaser\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-05-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, PAS fpc, GO, HASK, PERL, SCALA, PAS gpc, CAML, ASM, PERL6\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

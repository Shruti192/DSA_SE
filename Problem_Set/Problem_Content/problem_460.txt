b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a nice job. Actually he doesn't even remember what he is supposed to do there, because he just plays video-games all the time, exactly h hours every working day!\nRecently he got bored of just randomly playing video-games and decided to complete all the levels of his favorite Game as fast as possible.\nThe Game consists of n levels numbered with integers from 1 to n. After completing every level, some small number of new levels is unlocked. The structure of the Game levels is a tree with the root in level 1, i.e. every level (except for 1) has a unique level that unlocks it and level 1 is the only level that is considered unlocked at the very beginning. Chef has completed his favorite Game lots of times, so he knows that he needs exactly ti hours to complete level i. Due to specifics of the Game every level should be completed entirely within one working day, i.e. Chef cannot start a level on Thursday, and finish it Friday morning.\nOverall the game-play proceeds as follows:\n\nThere is a stack S that initially contains only the level 1\nChef pops the topmost level out of the stack. Let's call this level x\nChef spends tx hours to complete level x. Note that he doesn't want to stay at work longer than for h hours, so if there is not enough time left today Chef will complete level x the next working day morning.\nAfter completing level x some mx new levels get unlocked\nChef places all the mx unlocked levels on the top of the stack S in an arbitrary order, i.e. he is free to choose any order he likes\nIf stack S is empty, the Game is considered completed, otherwise Chef goes back to the step 2\n\nCan you help Chef figure out the minimum number of working days necessary to complete the Game?\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. \nFor each test case, the first line of input contains two integers n and h. \nThe next line contains n space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 t1, t2, ..., tn.\nThe following n lines describe the structure of Game's levels: the x-th of them contains an integer mx followed by mx integers \xe2\x80\x95 the levels that get unlocked after completing level x.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of working days necessary to complete the Game.\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ti \xe2\x89\xa4 h \xe2\x89\xa4 24\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 mx \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n It is guaranteed that the structure of the Game levels is a tree, i.e. it is possible to unlock all n levels and every level (except for 1) has exactly one other level that unlocks it.\n\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1: n \xe2\x89\xa4 9 (7 points)\nSubtask #2: mx \xe2\x89\xa4 2 (20 points)\nSubtask #3: n \xe2\x89\xa4 100; h \xe2\x89\xa4 8 (27 points)\nSubtask #4: Original constraints (46 points)\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n5 24\n13 24 22 12 16\n1 3\n0\n2 2 5\n0\n1 4\n10 8\n1 4 3 1 7 3 2 2 4 4\n3 2 5 10\n2 3 4\n0\n0\n1 6\n3 7 8 9\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nOutput:\n5\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef has to complete every level during separate working days, and so to complete all 5 levels he needs 5 working days.\n\n\nExample case 2: Chef will complete the Game if he will always push unlocked levels into stack starting with the largest indexed one and ending with the smallest indexed one. That is, after Chef completes level 1 he first pushes level 10 (S = [10]), then level 5 (S = [10, 5]) and then level 2 (S = [10, 5, 2]). So the second level Chef will play is 2.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alex_2oo8\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FAVGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2512\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-08-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

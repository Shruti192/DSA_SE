b'\nChef is planning to eliminate the ghosts from his house with the help of some magical bullets he has. Each bullet has some power level PiPi. A ghost can sometimes destroy the magical bullets if it possesses any of the skill S in the range 2 to K (both inclusive) such that S is a factor of PiPi.\nGiven the set of guns (the power of the guns), Chef is having and chef wants to pick only those guns such that the ghost cannot destroy the bullet. Also whenever Chef picks up another gun the power level of this gun should be strictly greater than the previously used gun. He also does not want to alter the order of guns.\nA ghost is eliminated only when the sum of powers of bullets it is shot with is greater than or equal to a value X.\nGiven the powers of guns, the value of K, and the value of X for a ghost find out whether this ghost can be killed or not.\ninput\n\nfirst line contains tt number of test cases\nfirst line of each test-case contains three space separated integers N,K,XN,K,X\nsecond line of each test-case contains NN space separated integers, PiPi\n\noutput\nfor each test-case, print "YES" if ghost can be killed ,else "NO"\nconstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41021\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4102\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,X\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,X\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41042\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nexample input\n1\n5 4 3\n1 9 5 7 2\n\nexample output\nYES\n\nexplanation\nchef can pick bullets 1,5,7 and hence the ghost is killed\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85skrstv123\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAGIC123\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy, enno2020, sieve, skrstv123\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

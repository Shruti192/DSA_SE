b'\nJanmansh and Jay are playing a game. They start with a number XX and they play a total of YY moves. Janmansh plays the first move of the game, after which both the players make moves alternatingly. \nIn one move, a player can increment or decrement XX by 11. \nIf the final number after performing YY moves is even, then Janmansh wins otherwise, Jay wins. Determine the winner of the game if both the players play optimally.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers XX, YY - the starting number and the total number of moves respectively.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the winning player (Janmansh or Jay).\nYou may print each character of Janmansh and Jay in uppercase or lowercase (for example, JAY, jaY, JAy will be considered identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2\n4 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nJanmansh\nJay\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case-1: The starting number is X=2X=2. One of the optimal games will be: \n\nIn the first move, Janmansh increases XX to 33.\nIn the second move, Jay increases XX to 44.\n\nSince the final number is even, Janmansh wins.\nTest case-2: The starting number is X=4X=4. One of the optimal games will be: \n\nIn the first move, Janmansh decreases XX to 33.\nIn the second move, Jay decreases XX to 22.\nIn the third move, Janmansh increases XX to 33.\n\nSince the final number is odd, Jay wins.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85janmansh\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85tabr\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/JGAMES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, cook139, janmansh, math\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n772\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

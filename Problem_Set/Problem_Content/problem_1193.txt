b'\nThere are three friends MotaMota , ChotuaChotua and ExpertExpert. Recently they all get placed  at reputed MNC.  MotaMota, a foodie person have already  decided to spend all his money on Samosa, while his friends ChotuaChotua and ExpertExpert have different plans and there cumulative salary is NN coins. \nChotuaChotua and ExpertExpert are competitive in nature and due to  this  their friend MotaMota decided to give equal numbers of coins to both of them  people.\nHe has two options\n\nChoose some number kk. Considering all coins identical, give kk coins to ChotuaChotua. Next, treat remaining n\xe2\x88\x92kn\xe2\x88\x92k coins as distinct and give kk coins to ExpertExpert. Lets say there are p1p1 ways to do so for all possible kk.\nChoose some number kk. Considering all coins distinct, give kk coins to ChotuaChotua. Next ,treat remaining n\xe2\x88\x92kn\xe2\x88\x92k coins as identical and give kk coins to ExpertExpert. Lets say there are p2p2 ways to do so for all possible kk.\n\nCalculate the ratio of p1p1 and  p2p2 . As this number can be rather large,he asks you to count the remainder after dividing it with 109+7109+7.\nNote it is guaranteed that nn is odd.\nInput Format:\n\n1st1st line contains TT which denotes number of testcase.\nFollowing TT lines contains single integer NN denoting cumulative salary .\n\nOutput Format:\n\nA single integer denoting the ratio of p1p1 and  p2p2 modulo 109109 ++ 77.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41018\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41018\xe2\x88\x921 where NN is odd\n\nSample Input\n2\n1\n3\nSample Output\n1\n750000006\nExplanation\n\nIn the first case there is only one way for the first option , 0 coins to both i.e p1=1 .Similarly one way for the second option i.e  p2=1. p1/p2=1; \nIn Second case ,here are 4 ways for option 2 {0 coins to both},{1st coin to B},{2nd coin to B},{3rd coin to B}.So p2=4there are 3 ways\n\n1-> 0 coins to both\n2,3-> 1 coins to B then 2 ways to pick 1 coin from the remaining 2 coins.\nFor the first option ie p1=3. \nHence answer is (3/4)(3/4) % 10000000071000000007 =750000006=750000006\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85gaurav_2000\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INQU2004\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy-medium, gaurav_2000, inso2020, math, matrix-exponentiation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-09-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\nYou are given a matrix A that consists of N rows and M columns. Every number in the matrix is either zero or one. Calculate the number of such triples (i, j, h) where for all the pairs (x, y), where both x and y belong to [1; h] if y >= x, A[i+x-1][j+y-1] equals to one. Of course, the square (i, j, i+h-1, j+h-1) should be inside of this matrix. In other words, we're asking you to calculate the amount of square submatrices of a given matrix which have ones on and above their main diagonal.\nInput\nThe first line of the input consists of two integers - N and M.\nThe following N lines describe the matrix. Each line consists of M characters that are either zero or one.\nOutput\nOutput should consist of a single integer - the answer to the problem.\nExample\nInput:\n2 3\n011\n111\n\nOutput:\n6\n\nScoring\nSubtask 1 (9 points): 1 <= N,M <= 2000, All the numbers in the matrix are equal to one.\nSubtask 2 (12 points): 1 <= N,M <= 10. \nSubtask 3 (34 points): 1 <= N,M <= 30. \nSubtask 4 (17 points): 1 <= N,M <= 150. \nSubtask 5 (28 points): 1 <= N,M <= 2000. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rubanenko\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MATRIX2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2209\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-07-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

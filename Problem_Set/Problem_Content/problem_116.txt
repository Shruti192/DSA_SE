b'\nRead problem statement in Mandarin chinese and Vietnamese.\nTweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum are playing a fierce match of binary Nim. This novel game is played with NN stacks, each of them containing only 11-s and 00-s.\nJust like in normal Nim, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum alternate turns; in their turn, a player must choose one non-empty stack and remove a positive number of elements from the top of this stack. However, Tweedle-Dee may only choose a stack with 00 at the top (and remove elements from it afterwards), and similarly, Tweedle-Dum may only choose a stack with 11 at the top. the player that cannot make a move loses\nSuzumo does not want to wait for the end of the game, so given the starting player he asks you to determine the winner. Remember that Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum are legendary grandmasters of combinatorial games, so both always play optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN, a string SS denoting the number of stacks, the player that starts the game, respectively.\nEach of the following NN lines contains a single binary string BB representing a stack; the first character of BB corresponds to the top element of the stack and the last character to the bottom element.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Dee" if Tweedle-Dee wins the match or "Dum" if Tweedle-Dum wins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|B|\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4|B|\xe2\x89\xa450\neach character in BB is either \'1\' or \'0\'\nSS is either "Dee" or "Dum"\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 Dee\n101\n010\n2 Dum\n101\n010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nDum\nDee\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BINIM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Game Theory, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1727\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-04-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

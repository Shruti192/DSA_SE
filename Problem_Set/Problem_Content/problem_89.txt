b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef owns a fast food shop that is currently located in a city called Chefland. He is planning to move his shop to a bigger city called Chefabad. There are NN consecutive days (numbered 11 through NN) such that the move can be done before day 11, after day NN or between any two consecutive days. Moving the shop takes zero time. Chef wants to time the move in a way thay maximises his profit during these NN days.\nFor each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), we know that if Chef's shop is in Chefland on the ii-th day, he earns AiAi coins, while if it is in Chefabad on this day, he earns BiBi coins. Find the maximum profit Chef can make if he optimally chooses the time when the shop should move. Note that once the shop has moved to Chefabad, it cannot return to Chefland.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases.

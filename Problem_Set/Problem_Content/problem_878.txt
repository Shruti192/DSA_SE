b'\nMausil is a real estate agent, belonging to Pajal. He has a plan to build a series of MM buildings in Pajal and for this he found a land which can accommodate MM buildings in a row one after another. The rule of the Pajal government is that no building in Pajal can have more than NN floors. Based on a few factors like cost of the land, water resources etc. the cost of constructing a building is not the same in all pieces of land and it also depends on the number of floors you want to have in that building.  \nA community is a maximal group of buildings which have the same number of floors. For example: buildingsbuildings = [1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,3][1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,3] has 4 communities - {(1,1,1),(2,2),(1),(3,3,3)}{(1,1,1),(2,2),(1),(3,3,3)}. Mausil wants to have exactly KK communities in this project.\nBut in this land few buildings were already constructed. Mausil doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to collapse them. He wants to leave all the buildings which were already constructed as they are and construct buildings in the empty pieces of land. \nSo given an array buildingsbuildings, an M\xc3\x97NM\xc3\x97N matrix costcost and an integer KK where:\n\nbuildings[i]buildings[i] denotes the number of floors that ithith building has if it is positive and if it is 00, it denotes an empty piece of land in which a building has to be constructed.\ncost[i][j]cost[i][j] denotes the cost of constructing a building in ithith piece of land with jj floors.\n\nIf CC denotes the minimum total cost required for constructing all the buildings in empty pieces of land such that there are exactly KK communities. You are definitely smarter than Mausil, so please help Mausil to find CC. If it is not possible to have exactly KK communities return \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input has a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case has 33 space separated integers M,NM,N and KK.\nSecond line of each test case has MM space separated integers denoting the Buildings array.\nThe following MM lines for each test case have NN space separated integers in each line, denoting the M\xc3\x97NM\xc3\x97N cost matrix of that test case. \n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case print a single integer CC if it is possible to have KK communities, else print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4201\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Buildings[i]\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4Buildings[i]\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Cost[i][j]\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4Cost[i][j]\xe2\x89\xa4104\n\nSample Input:\n5 2 3\n0 2 1 2 0\n1 10\n10 1\n10 1\n1 10\n5 1\n\nSample Output:\n11\n\nExplanation:\nThree buildings were already constructed, if we construct the remaining houses in optimal way the resultant Buildings array would be [2,2,1,2,2][2,2,1,2,2]. This land has 33 communities, (2,2),(1),(2,2)(2,2),(1),(2,2). The cost of construction here is Cost[1][2]+Cost[5][2]=10+1=11Cost[1][2]+Cost[5][2]=10+1=11(considering 1-based indexing).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85karthikeya619\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MKCOM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cvxh2020, dynamic-programming, karthikeya619\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

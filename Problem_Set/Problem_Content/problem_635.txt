b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  , Russian and Vietnamese\nSergey works as a programmer. Like all programmers, he is a coffee fan. He likes coffee so much that has K cups of coffee daily. However, having more than K cups doesn't suit him, because the excess caffeine won't allow him to sleep at night.\nSergey's working day is divided into N periods. For every period, he knows how many kilobytes of code he can produce.\nDuring each of the periods, Sergey can either have or not to have one cup of coffee. If he is having a cup of coffee in some period, the amount of code he writes in this period drops to zero. But he also gets a productivity boost \xe2\x80\x94 if he decides to skip coffee during a period and the last cup of coffee he had was no more than D periods ago, the amount of code he writes during such a period is M times the usual.\nAs his productivity advisor (congrats on your new job!), help Sergey plan his coffee breaks optimally. Please find the maximum number of lines of code he can write, provided that he has exactly K coffee breaks during the day.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space separated integers N, K, D and M denoting the number of the working periods, the number of coffee-breaks and two more parameters as described in the statement.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ... , AN denoting the number of kilobytes of code that Sergey writes during each period.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the maximum number of kilobytes of code that Sergey can produce if he takes exactly K coffee breaks.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 200\nIn subtasks 1-3 it holds that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of all N over the test case \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nSubtask 1 (15 points): K = 1, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 D < N \xe2\x89\xa4 18\nSubtask 2 (25 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K, D < N \xe2\x89\xa4 18\nSubtask 3 (30 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K, D < N \xe2\x89\xa4 200\nSubtask 4 (30 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K, D < N \xe2\x89\xa4 5000, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of all N over the test case \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M, Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n5 2 2 10\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput:\n110\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Sergey will have coffee during the periods numbered 1 and 3. In these periods, the amount of code he produces will be zero, but during the rest, his code production quantities will get multiplied by 10. Thus, we will write (2 + 4 + 5) * 10 KB of code.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85logic_iu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COFFEE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2773\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-08-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

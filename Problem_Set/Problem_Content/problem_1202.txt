Your task is to determine whether they can meet or not.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n\nThe 1st line contains coordinates of city A separated by space - AxAx AyAy\nThe 2nd line contains coordinates of city B separated by space - BxBx ByBy\nThe 3rd line contains coordinates of city C separated by space - CxCx CyCy\nThe 4th line contains coordinates of city D separated by space - DxDx DyDy\n\nThe source and destination of journey are distinct and does not lie on same route.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line "YES" if they can meet, otherwise "NO" (without quotes).\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By,Cx,Cy,Dx,Dy\xe2\x89\xa4106\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By,Cx,Cy,Dx,Dy\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\n\nSample Input:\n2\n5 -1\n8 7\n0 0\n10 3\n3 5\n0 2\n2 0\n7 5\n\n\nSample Output:\nYES\nNO\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nTest case 1: Jethalal and Mehta can meet at point E.\n\nTest case 2: Jethalal and Mehta can not meet.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85rishabhrathi22\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CAKP06\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, easy, geometry, math, rishabhrathi22\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

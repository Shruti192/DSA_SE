More formally, there are at most KK indices ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N) such that Ai\xe2\x89\xa0Ai+1Ai\xe2\x89\xa0Ai+1. Note that according to this definition, if an array AA is KK-beautiful, then AA is also (K+1)(K+1)-beautiful.\nYou are given an array AA consisting of NN integers and an integer KK. Find the length of the longest KK-beautiful subsequence of AA, where a subsequence is defined below.\nFor example, consider the array A=[1,1,2,3,2,4]A=[1,1,2,3,2,4]. The subsequences [1,1][1,1] and [1,1,2][1,1,2] are 11-beautiful, and the subsequences [1,2,3][1,2,3] and [1,2,2,4][1,2,2,4] are 22-beautiful.\nNote: A sequence aa is a subsequence of a sequence bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1][3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1][3,2,1] and [4,3,1][4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7][1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4][3,10,4].\nInput Format\nThe first line contains an integer TT - the number of test cases. Then TT test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NN, KK - the length of array AA and the parameter for a beautiful sequence.\nThe second line of each testcase contains NN integers A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the maximum possible length of a KK-beautiful subsequence of AA.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n4 1\n1 1 2 3\n9 2\n1 2 3 2 4 5 6 7 5\n5 5\n1 1 1 1 1\n10 1\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\n5\n6\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTest Case 1 : You can either choose [1,1,2][1,1,2] or [1,1,3][1,1,3] as a subsequence. Both of the subsequences are 11-beautiful. So the maximum length of a 11-beautiful subsequence is 33.\nTest Case 2 : It is optimal to choose the subsequence [1,2,2,5,5][1,2,2,5,5]. So the maximum length of a 22-beautiful subsequence is 55.\nTest Case 3 : You can choose the entire array as a subsequence because the given array is KK-beautiful for any K\xe2\x89\xa50K\xe2\x89\xa50, which includes K=5K=5.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BEAUSUB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bottom-up\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2472\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-07-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

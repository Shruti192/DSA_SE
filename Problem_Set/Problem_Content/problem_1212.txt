b'\nTracy is teaching Charlie maths via a game called NN-Cube, which involves three sections involving NN.\nTracy gives Charlie a number NN, and Charlie makes a list of NN-th powers of integers in increasing order 1N,2N,3N,,\xcb\x99so on1N,2N,3N,,\xcb\x99so on. This teaches him exponentiation.\nThen Charlie performs the following subtraction game NN times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if NN was 6, the list proceeds as [1,64,729,4096...][1,64,729,4096...] to [63,685,3367...][63,685,3367...], and so on 55 more times.\nAfter the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the NN-th element of the list. This number is the value of the game. \nAfter practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers MM (where MM is a prime) and RR instead of just a single number NN, and the game must start from MR\xe2\x88\x921MR\xe2\x88\x921 instead of NN. Since the value of the game can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer KK such that MKMK divides this number. Since even KK can be large, output KK modulo 1000000007 (109+7109+7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers M,RM,R. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Charlie to Tracy modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa410000\n70 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nMM is a prime number\nSample Input:\n1\n2 2\n\nSample Output:\n1\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis list is :\n[1,8,27,64,125..]\xe2\x88\x92>[7,19,37,61..]\xe2\x88\x92>[12,18,24..]\xe2\x88\x92>[6,6,6..][1,8,27,64,125..]\xe2\x88\x92>[7,19,37,61..]\xe2\x88\x92>[12,18,24..]\xe2\x88\x92>[6,6,6..].

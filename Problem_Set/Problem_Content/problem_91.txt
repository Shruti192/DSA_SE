b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef Al Gorithm was reading a book about climate and oceans when he encountered the word \xe2\x80\x9cglaciological\xe2\x80\x9d. He thought it was quite curious, because it has the following interesting property: For every two letters in the word, if the first appears x times and the second appears y times, then |x - y| \xe2\x89\xa4 1.\nChef Al was happy about this and called such words 1-good words. He also generalized the concept: He said a word was K-good if for every two letters in the word, if the first appears x times and the second appears y times, then |x - y| \xe2\x89\xa4 K.\nNow, the Chef likes K-good words a lot and so was wondering: Given some word w, how many letters does he have to remove to make it K-good?\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line containing two things: a word w and an integer K, separated by a space.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer: the minimum number of letters he has to remove to make the word K-good.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |w| \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nw contains only lowercase English letters.\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\nglaciological 1\nteammate 0\npossessions 3\ndefenselessness 3\n\nOutput:\n0\n0\n1\n2\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The word \xe2\x80\x9cglaciological\xe2\x80\x9d is already 1-good, so the Chef doesn't have to remove any letter.\nExample case 2. Similarly, \xe2\x80\x9cteammate\xe2\x80\x9d is already 0-good.\nExample case 3. The word \xe2\x80\x9cpossessions\xe2\x80\x9d is 4-good. To make it 3-good, the Chef can remove the last s to make \xe2\x80\x9cpossession\xe2\x80\x9d.\nExample case 4. The word \xe2\x80\x9cdefenselessness\xe2\x80\x9d is 4-good. To make it 3-good, Chef Al can remove an s and an e to make, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cdefenslesness\xe2\x80\x9d. Note that the word doesn't have to be a valid English word.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nTester:\n\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KGOOD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-05-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

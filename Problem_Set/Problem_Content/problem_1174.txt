b"\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef and Abhishek are two friends. Abhishek really appreciates Chef's skills and wants to learn the secret formula behind Chef's tasty dishes. Chef will tell his secret formula only to a \ncompetent person. So to check Abhishek's competency, Chef asked him to solve the following problem.  \nFind the number of integers between 00 and NN (inclusive) such that the product of digits of the integer is greater than or equal to K!K!, where KK is the number of digits present in the integer.  \nExample: Consider N=1000N=1000. \n\nThe only digit present in the integer 00 is 00. So the product of digit is also 00 and 1!=11!=1. So 00 will be not counted in the answer because 0\xe2\x89\xaf10\xe2\x89\xaf1.\nThe digits present in the integer 2525 are 2,52,5. So the product of digits is (2\xe2\x8b\x855)=10(2\xe2\x8b\x855)=10 and 2!=22!=2. So 2525 will be counted in the answer because  10\xe2\x89\xa5210\xe2\x89\xa52. \nThe digits present in the integer 1111 are 1,11,1. So the product of digits is (1\xe2\x8b\x851)=1(1\xe2\x8b\x851)=1 and 2!=22!=2. So 1111 will be not counted in the answer because 1\xe2\x89\xaf21\xe2\x89\xaf2.\nThe digits present in the integer 157157 are 1,5,71,5,7. So the product of digits is (1\xe2\x8b\x855\xe2\x8b\x857)=35(1\xe2\x8b\x855\xe2\x8b\x857)=35 and  3!=63!=6. So 157157 will be counted in the answer because 35\xe2\x89\xa5635\xe2\x89\xa56. \n\nSince Abhishek is a lazy person, he wants your help to solve the problem.  \nNote: K!K! represents the factorial of KK and K!=1\xe2\x8b\x852\xe2\x8b\x853\xe2\x8b\x85\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x8b\x85(K\xe2\x88\x921)\xe2\x8b\x85KK!=1\xe2\x8b\x852\xe2\x8b\x853\xe2\x8b\x85\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x8b\x85(K\xe2\x88\x921)\xe2\x8b\x85K .  \nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases.

The two-digit numbers that will not be included in the answer are 10,1110,11 because their product of digits is less than 2!=22!=2. So the answer is =14\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x922=11=14\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x922=11. \nTest case 33:   \n\nThe one-digit number that will not be counted in the answer is 00. \nThe two-digit digit numbers that will not be counted in the answer are 10,1110,11, 20,3020,30, 40,50,60,40,50,60, 70,80,9070,80,90 because their product of digits is less than 2!=22!=2. \nThe three-digit numbers that will not be counted in the answer are 100100, 101,102,101,102, 103,104,105103,104,105, 106,107,108106,107,108, 109,110,111,109,110,111, 112,113,114,112,113,114, 115,120115,120,121,121, 122,130,131,122,130,131, 140,141,150,140,141,150, 151,160,170151,160,170, 180,190180,190 because their product of digits is less than 3!=63!=6.\nSo the answer is =199\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x88\x9229=159=199\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x88\x9229=159.  \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85abhisek_12345\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDIGLNUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Digit DP, Mathematics, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2941\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

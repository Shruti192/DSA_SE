b'\nRichie Rich invited his best friend Mark to his mansion. Richie then showed him the room where he keeps his pocket money. There was a whole Mountain Range made of money inside the room. Mark could not believe his eyes. He asked Richie if he could take some of it. Richie said he could only take money from a Perfect Range of the mountain.\nGiven the height of the mountain range at n consecutive points i.e. x1,x2,x3.....xnx1,x2,x3.....xn, (Where xixi denotes the height of the mountain range at x=ix=i) and m queries consisting of two integers ll and rr ( ll, rr define a segment in the array of heights ), find for each query, whether the given segment of the mountain range is a Perfect Range.\nA Perfect Range of mountains contains exactly one peak.\nA range consisting of a peak will look like ai<ai+1<ai+2.....<ax>ax+1>ax+2....>ajai<ai+1<ai+2.....<ax>ax+1>ax+2....>aj . (i\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4ji\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4j)  \nIf Mark can take money from the segment given in a query, print YES. Else print NO.   \nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer nn denoting the number of points where the height sample has been taken.\nSecond-line contains nn integers denoting the heights of the Mountain range.\nThe third line of input contains an integer mm denoting the total number of queries.\nNext mm lines following this, contains mm queries, each line containing two integers ll and rr, denoting the segment.\n\nOutput:\nFor each query, print Yes or No.  \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4l,r\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4l,r\xe2\x89\xa4n\nl\xe2\x89\xa4rl\xe2\x89\xa4r\n0\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n14\n10 9 8 7 5 6 5 4 3 4 5 6 7 8\n4\n1 4\n4 6\n5 7\n11 14  \nSample Output:\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/REC09C\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy, rec92019, rishup_nitdgp\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-11-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

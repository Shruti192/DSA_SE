b'\nMr. Vasu being one of the top coders in his college was given the responsibility to organize a coding contest for NIT Kurukshetra\xe2\x80\x99s tech festival. Although he was very good at solving questions, he found that it was a much harder task to make questions. The contest\xe2\x80\x99s date was coming close and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with any problems. Finally, Mr. Vasu decides to copy questions from a website to make the contest (not a decision he was very proud of).\nThe website has NN number of questions. Each of the questions has a difficulty rating associated with it. The ith question has a difficulty DiDi. You are given a list of the difficulty rating of all the questions. Vasu has to select QQ questions out of them (2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4N2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4N). He wants the minimum rating difference between any two questions out of all the questions that he selected should be maximized.\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains a single integer NN, denoting the number of questions\nThe second line contains QQ which denotes the number of questions Vasu has to pick.\nThe third line contains NN space-separated integers in ascending order denoting the difficulty rating of the question.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the largest minimum rating difference between any two questions selected by Vasu.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41062\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4N2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n5\n3 \n1 2 8 4 9\n\nSample Output:\n3\n\nEXPLANATION:\nVasu can select the questions with difficulty rating 11, 44 and 88 resulting in a minimum rating difference of 33.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85vasu2907\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ENC2020D\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 binary-search, dynamic-programming, enco2020, vasu2907\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

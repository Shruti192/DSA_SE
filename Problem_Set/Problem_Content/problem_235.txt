b'\nJJ has a binary string SS of length NN. JJ can perform the following operation on SS:\n\nSelect an ii such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N, and flip SiSi (i.e. change 00 to 11 and 11 to 00)\n\nJJ wants to minimize the number of inversions in SS by performing the above operation at most KK times. Can you help JJ do so?\nRecall that a pair of indices (i,j)(i,j) in SS is called an inversion if i<ji<j and Si>SjSi>Sj.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NN and KK - the length of the binary string SS and the maximum number of times JJ can perform the given operation.\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string SS of length NN containing 00s and 11s only.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of inversions possible after performing the given operation at most KK times.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\nSum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n8 3\n00010111\n5 1\n10100\n6 2\n111000\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: We are allowed to perform at most 33 operations. We can perform the following operation on SS: 00010\xe2\x80\x93111\xe2\x86\x920001111100010_111\xe2\x86\x9200011111 which has 00 inversions. Therefore 00 is the answer.\nTest case 2: We can perform the following operation on SS: 1\xe2\x80\x930100\xe2\x86\x92001001_0100\xe2\x86\x9200100 which has 22 inversions. It can be proven that this is the minimum number of inversions possible.\nTest case 3: We can perform the following operations on SS: 11100\xe2\x80\x930\xe2\x86\x92111010\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x86\x9211101111100_0\xe2\x86\x92111010_\xe2\x86\x92111011 which has 33 inversions. It can be proven that this is the minimum number of inversions possible.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85jeevanjyot\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FLIPINV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 april222, greedy, jeevanjyot\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2692\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

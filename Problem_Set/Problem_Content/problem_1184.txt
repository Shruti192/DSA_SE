b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nGritukan likes to take cyclic trips around the world. There are NN countries numbered 11 through NN in the world. Before starting his travels, Gritukan chooses a permutation PP of all NN countries. Then, he visits all countries (some countries may be visited multiple times) using the following algorithm:\n\nfor each vv from 11 to NN inclusive:\ntravel to country vv\ntravel from country vv to country PvPv, then from country PvPv to country PPvPPv, and so on until he reaches country vv again; let's call this sequence of visited countries a cyclic route\n\n(Each country appears at most once in a cyclic route. It is also possible for a route to contain only one country if v=Pvv=Pv, in which case Gritukan's travel along this route consists of staying in country vv.)\nUnfortunately, Gritukan does not remember the routes he took. He only remembers a sequence A1..NA1..N with the following meaning: for each country vv, the number of cyclic routes which contained this country is AvAv. Given the sequence AA, Gritukan asks you to calculate the number of permutations PP consistent with this sequence, modulo 998244353998244353 (it's prime).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of possible permutations modulo 998244353998244353 (it's prime).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (40 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000\nSubtask #2 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n6\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n6\n6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n120\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85altruist_\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FFT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics, Convolution, FFT\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algebra, Transformations, Polynomial\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2503\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-04-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

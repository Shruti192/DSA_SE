b'\nConsider two sequences A and B comprising of digits 0 to 9, of length K and L respectively. The distance from A to B is the total minimum penalty incurred in converting A to B using the following operations, each of which incurs a penalty as described below.\n\nReplacing a digit of A with another digit: incurs a penalty of 1\nInserting a digit in A: incurs a penalty of 1 for each digit inserted. In addition, there is also a fixed penalty of x for every sequence of digits inserted (one-time penalty for starting the sequence, not per-digit). However, the total penalty charged for a sequence of digits inserted never exceeds y (y > x). For example, if x = 2 and y = 5, then inserting a one digit sequence (say \xe2\x80\x9c5\xe2\x80\x9d) will incur a penalty of 3 (=x+1), a 2-digit sequence (say \xe2\x80\x9c24\xe2\x80\x9d) will incur a penalty of 4 (=x+2), and inserting any n-digit sequence (n > 2) (say \xe2\x80\x9c132\xe2\x80\x9d, 2543\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9c57241\xe2\x80\x9d etc.) will all incur a penalty of 5 (=y).\nDeleting a digit from A: incurs a penalty of 1 for each digit deleted. In addition, there is also a fixed penalty of x for every sequence of digits deleted (one-time penalty for starting the sequence, not per-digit).\n\nWhat is the minimum penalty with which A can be converted to B?\nInput\nThe first line contains the number of tests cases N\nFor each test case, the first line contains the integers K and L. The second line contains the sequence A (K digits with no space in between). The third line contains the sequence B (L digits with no space in between). The fourth line contains the integers x and y .\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by a single integer representing the minimum penalty.\nConstraints\n0 < N \xe2\x89\xa4 3\n0 < K \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 < L \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nx > 0, y > x\nExample\nInput:\n3\n9 1\n123456789\n1\n10 15\n1 9\n1\n123456789\n10 15\n11 4\n12345678912\n1212\n10 15\n\nOutput:\nCase 1: 18\nCase 2: 15\nCase 3: 17\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\njingbo_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KGP13I\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy-medium, jingbo_adm, kgp13acm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-12-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.613636 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\nGaius Julius Caesar, a famous general, loved to line up his soldiers. Overall the army had N1 footmen and N2 horsemen. Caesar thought that an arrangement is not beautiful if somewhere in the line there are strictly more that K1 footmen standing successively one after another, or there are strictly more than K2 horsemen standing successively one after another. Find the number of beautiful arrangements of the soldiers.\nNote that all N1+N2 warriors should be present at each arrangement. All footmen are considered indistinguishable among themselves. Similarly, all horsemen are considered indistinguishable among themselves.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains 4 space separated integers N1, N2, K1, K2 - which represent how many footmen and horsemen are there and the largest acceptable number of footmen and horsemen standing in succession, correspondingly.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the number of beautiful arrangements of the army modulo 1000000007 (109+7). That is, print the number of such ways to line up the soldiers, that no more than K1 footmen stand successively, and no more than K2 horsemen stand successively.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N1 \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N2 \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 K1 \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K2 \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 1 1 10\n2 3 1 2\n2 4 1 1\nOutput:\n1\n5\n0\n\nExplanation\nLet's mark a footman as 1, and a horseman as 2.\nExample case 1.  The only beautiful line-up is: 121.\nExample case 2.  5 beautiful line-ups exist: 12122, 12212, 21212, 21221, 22121\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85puneetguptaa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDX1602\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, medium, puneetguptaa\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-07-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nStatement\nYet another game from chef. Chef gives you N cards and M bags. Each of the N cards has an integer written on it. Now chef asks you to close your eyes and choose a subset of them. He then sums the numbers written on chosen cards, takes its absolute value and gives you those many coins. You win the game if you can divide these coins into M bags with each bag having equal share. As a first step to calculate the probability of winning, you would like to know the number of different subsets which will make you win. Note that all the cards are of different color, so even if 2 cards have the same number written on it, they are still considered as different cards.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nFirst line of each test case contains two integers N and Q. Q denotes the number of queries to be answered. Second line of each test case contains N integers, the numbers written on cards.\nFollowing Q lines contain an integer M.\nOutput\nFor each query output the required Answer modulo 1000000009. Answer is the number of subsets that will ensure you win.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 3\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n-10^9 \xe2\x89\xa4 Number on card \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n\n \nExample\nInput\n2\n5 1\n1 2 -1 4 5\n9\n5 2\n1 2 3 4 5\n5\n15\n\nOutput\n4\n8\n2\n\nExplanation\nTest Case #1, Query #1\n{}, {1,-1}, {1,-1,4,5}, {4,5} are winning subsets. Sums are 0, 0, 9, 9 respectively.\nTest Case #2, Query #1\n{}, {5}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {1,4,5}, {2,3,5}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4,5} are winning subsets. Sums are 0, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 15 respectively.\nTest Case #2, Query #2\n{}, {1,2,3,4,5} are winning subsets. Sums are 0 and 15 respectively.\nAuthor's Note\nTime Limit is not very strict (Yes, not very loose either) if correct Algorithm is used.Author's solution passes with 2 sec Time Limit (C++ solution, using scanf and printf).\nMaximum Input File Size < 4MB.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anudeep2011\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85white_king\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ANUCBC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Combinatorics, DP Approach\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2262\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-01-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\n\xc2\xa0\nWhat are the total number of ways in which you can write a word, given number of each vowels that can be used, print that number of ways modulo 10^9+7. In that word, same vowel can be repeated contiguously,(boldness for emphasis). Check example just below:\n\n\nExample: aba is same as aaba, abaa, abaaaaa, abaaaaaaaaa,aaaaba,aaabaaa. But consonants must be placed as it is between the vowels.\n\n\nYou will be given an array of length 5 (that is 5 space separated integers) where 0 index represents count of a, 1 count of e, 2 count of i, 3 count of o and 4 count u. You will also be given a word "G" consisting of lowercase alphabets without any repeated contiguous vowels.\n\n\nThere will be enough vowels to make the word.\nAll the given vowels in the array must be used up, if and only if that vowel is there in the given word "G".(quotes are used for clarity).\n\n\nExample: a is 5, e is 2, i is 3, o is 2, u is 4\nand G is "abu" , then the only way to write it is "aaaaabuuuu" (quotes for clarity), using all the 5 a\'s and 4 u\'s and since only \'a\' and \'u\' is there in the given word so we use those only.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nInput will start with an integer T the count of test cases. Each test case will have 5 space separated integers denoting count of each vowel on a newline. On the next line of each input there will be a word denoting the given word "G".\nOutput\nOutput an integer the answer for each input each on a newline.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Count of a,e,i,o,u each \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 length of given word G \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n1\n3 2 2 3 1\nbababu\n\nOutput:\n2\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1. There are two ways to write it, baababu and babaabu, we mod it with 10^9+7 and get 2. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85chandubaba\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/VOWELDP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 chandubaba, chandubaba, dynamic-programming, easy, keteki, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-12-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

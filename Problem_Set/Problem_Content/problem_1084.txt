b'\nLav has an array AA of size NN. He noticed that Chef is initially standing at the first index of the array.\nWhile standing at the ithith index (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N) of the array, Chef can perform the following types of jumps:\n\nJump 1Jump 1: Jump to the immediate next index jj such that AiAi and AjAj have the same parity.\nJump 2Jump 2: Jump to the immediate next index jj such that AiAi and AjAj have different parity.\n\nGiven that Chef can perform Jump 2Jump 2 at most once, Lav wants to find the minimum number of jumps required by the Chef to reach the last index of the array.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN - the size of the array AA.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN - the elements of the array AA.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of jumps required by the Chef to reach the last index of the array.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41042\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n1 2 3 4\n4\n2 1 3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 11:  The minimum number of jumps required by the Chef to reach the last index is 22.\nChef is initially standing at index 11.\n\nChef chooses Jump 2Jump 2 and jumps to index 22 as it is the immediate next element with different parity.\nChef chooses Jump 1Jump 1 and jumps to index 44 as it is the immediate next element with the same parity.\n\nTest Case 22:  The minimum number of jumps required by the Chef to reach the last index is 11.\nChef is currently standing at index 11.\n\nChef chooses Jump 1Jump 1 and jumps to index 44 as it is the immediate next element with the same parity.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85neerav_1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/JS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 math, math, neerav_1, parity, parity, simple, simple, start35, start35\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1888\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese as well.\nIt is well-known that \xe2\x88\x91sqrt(ai), ai \xe2\x88\x88 N is a root of some integer-coefficient polynomial. For example: sqrt(2) is a root of polynomial: x2 \xe2\x88\x92 2. Now, your task is to find not only such polynomial but also the minimal one. When comparing two polynomials, firstly, we consider their degree and then the coefficient of the highest term, and then the second highest term and so on. (Note that we consider only polynomial with the coefficient of highest term is positive)\n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer T denotes the number of test cases. Each test case is described by an integer n and followed by n space-separated integers ai.\nOutput:\nEach test case print an integer k denotes the degree of polynomial in a single line. Then next line print k + 1  space-separated integers modulo 109 + 7, coefficients from lowest to highest term.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 15\nai are n distinct primes, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1: (10 points):  n \xe2\x89\xa4 3\nSubtask #2: (20 points):  n \xe2\x89\xa4 5\nSubtask #3: (30 points):  n \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nSubtask #4: (40 points):  n \xe2\x89\xa4 15\n\nExample\nInput:\n\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2 3\n\nOutput:\n\n2\n1000000005 0 1\n4\n1 0 999999997 0 1\n\n\nExplanation\nThe first polynomial is x2 \xe2\x88\x92 2, and the second one is x4 \xe2\x88\x92 10x2 + 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85chemthan\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/APRPS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 chemthan, fast-fourier-transform, hard, july17, math, number-theoretic-transfmtn\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2969\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-02-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\n\n\n\n            "Nine is considered a good number in Chinese culture because it sounds the same as the word "long-lasting". Hence many\n            people want their car registration numbers to sum up to 9 on adding the digits recursively.\n        \n\n\n\nA car registration number can consist of 1,2,3 or 4 digits. Examples of some good car numbers are 63, 018, 9099, etc. whereas 12,129 are not            good.\n        \n\n\nWhy is 9099 good?\n\n\n9+0+9+9 = 27\n\n\n2+7 = 9 \n\n\nSimilarly it is not difficult to see why 63, 018, 6669, 9999\xe2\x80\xa6 are good."\n\n\n        Given a string of digits, print how many subsequences of the string result in good car registration numbers.\n    \n\nNote:\n\n\n        The zeros at the starting of the number are to be accounted for, i.e. 018 and 18 are different numbers.\n    \n\nInput\n\n\n        First line of the input contains T (T <= 200) denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing a non-empty single\n        string S. S contains only digits i.e. from [0-9]. Length of S <= 10000.\n    \n\nOutput\n\n\n        For each case print how many subsequences of the string result in good car registration numbers. As the answer can be quite large print it modulo 1000000007.\n    \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n10292\n0189\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nkaush_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LUKYDRIV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aug12, dynamic-programming, kaush_adm, number-theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1951\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-04-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.756881 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\nSereja had an non-negative integer A in the range [0, 10100].\n\n\nOne day, he wrote N pairs of the form (X[i],  floor(A / X[i]) ) on a piece of paper. Let us denote floor(A / X[i]) by D[i].\n\n\nSereja's little brother Sergey is very naughty, he changed the D values for some of the pairs. When confronted for his mischief by Sereja, he said that he did not touch more than K such pairs. \n\n\nNow, given the modified values of N pairs of the form (X[i], D[i]), Sereja is wondering about number of possible original values of integer A. Please help Sereja so that little Sergey could avoid the upcoming beating by Sereja. As the answer could be large, please report it modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contain an integer T \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.T test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains integers N and K. Each of the next N lines contains a pair that Sereja wrote on the paper \xe2\x80\x94 X[i] and D[i] \xe2\x80\x94 as two space-separated integers.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer - number of possible numbers A modulo (109+7).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X[i]  \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 D[i]  \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 0\n50 2\n40 2\n30 3\n3 1\n30 3\n40 2\n50 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n20\n30\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsereja_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SEAPAIR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Greedy, Sorting, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2449\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-11-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

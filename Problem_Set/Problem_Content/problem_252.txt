b'\nThere is an organisation having NN departments,where ithith department has MiMi members.\nVermajiVermaji wants to become president of this organisation and for this, he needs to get at least half of the votes in his favour from each department i.e \xe2\x8c\x88Mi/2\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88Mi/2\xe2\x8c\x89 members, where ithith department has MiMi members. However, he gets to know that none of the members wants to vote for him. As he wants to become president any how, he decides to bribe the members. He has procured N arrays where ithith array contains money demanded by each member of ithith department.\nVermajiVermaji has infinite amount of money, but being a smart and rich corrupted person he decides to bribe members in such a way that he can win the election and the maximum absolute difference between demands of any two member from any two departments (person may or may not be from same department ) is minimum.\nYou are his friend and also a good programmer. Help him in getting majority of votes i.e atleast \xe2\x8c\x88Mi/2\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88Mi/2\xe2\x8c\x89 from each department . Tell him the maximum absolute difference between the demands of any two bribed members of any two departments as well as maximum number of votes he can get. Total number of votes in favour of VermajiVermaji should always be greater than 11 in order to become leader.\nNoteNote: Absolute difference between two numbers xx,yy is ||xx\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92yy||\nInput Format:\n\nFirst line contains NN denoting number of departments in organisation.\nFor next NN lines, first integer MiMi denotes size of ithith department which is followed by MiMi space seperated integers denoting money demands of members of ithith department.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nOnly one line containing two space separated integers denoting minimum difference and maximum number of votes for that condition respectively.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\x91Ni=1Mi\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\x91i=1NMi\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4109,Where Ai,jAi,jdenotes jthjthelement of ithitharray.\n\nSample Input1:\n3 \n2 1 2\n3 -2 3 4 \n1 8\n\nSample Output1:\n6 4\n\nSample Input2:\n1\n2 1 2\n\nSample Output2:\n1 2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor sample test case 1-  List of demands fulfilled by Verma ji for above case is 2,3,4,8.\nFor sample test case 2- As it is necessary to have greater than 1 vote so Vermaji will buy votes from both the person. Hence max difference = (2-1)=1 and max people voting for him = 2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85gaurav_2000\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INQU2002\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 binary-search, easy-medium, gaurav_2000, greedy, inso2020, sorting, two-pointers\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef's apartment consists of MM floors (numbered 11 through MM), and there's an elevator that is used to move between different floors. The elevator is connected with a computer which registers its movement in a sequence BB. Whenever the elevator moves to a different floor, the computer appends the new floor number to sequence BB. Currently, the sequence BB has NN elements.\nUnfortunately, the computer is infected with a virus which replaced some elements of BB by \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921s. Chef now wants to know what could be the minimum number of times the elevator has changed its direction. That is, how many times the elevator was going up then started going down and vice versa. \nHelp chef by answering his question or determine that the sequence BB is invalid.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NN and MM. \nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of times the elevator has changed its direction or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if the given BB sequence is invalid.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4M or Bi=\xe2\x88\x921Bi=\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid ii\nsum of NN over all test-cases doesn't exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa41,000N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 10,00010,000\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): Original constraints\nSample Input:\n5\n4 5\n2 3 4 3\n4 5\n2 -1 4 3\n4 5\n1 -1 -1 5\n5 4\n-1 -1 3 -1 -1\n5 5\n-1 -1 3 -1 -1\n\nSample Output:\n1\n1\n-1\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ELEVATR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3248\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

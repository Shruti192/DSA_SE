b"\nThere is a binary string SS. Alice and Bob are playing a game on it.\nEach turn, the following happens:\n\nAlice selects a 0101 subsequence in SS and removes it from SS. (a 0101 subsequence is a length 22 subsequence whose first character is 00 and second character is 11)\nBob selects a 0101 subsequence in SS and removes it from SS.\nAfter both players have moved, the turn is called completed and Alice scores 11 point. Then, the next turn begins.\n\nIf either player is unable to move (there isn't any 0101 subsequence left in SS), that turn ends immediately and the game ends.\nAlice tries to maximize her points, while Bob tries to minimize Alice's points. Find how many points Alice would score if both players play optimally.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TT \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. \nEach of the next TT lines contains a binary string SS.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a new line a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 Alice's score when both players play optimally.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nThe sum of |S||S| across all tests doesn't exceed  2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (25 Points):\nThe sum of |S||S| across all tests doesn't exceed 100100\nSubtask 2 (25 Points):\nThe sum of |S||S| across all tests doesn't exceed 15001500\nSubtask 3 (50 Points):\nNo further constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n01010101\n0101\n10\n01001011\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 \n1 \n0 \n2 \n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example, this is one of the possible outcomes.\nTurn 11:\n\nAlice removes subsequence (1,2)(1,2) from SS, so SS becomes 010101.\nBob removes subsequence (3,6)(3,6) from SS, so SS becomes 0110.\nAlice scores one point and the first turn ends.\n\nTurn 2:\n\nAlice removes subsequence (1,2)(1,2) from SS, so SS becomes 10.\nBob has nothing to do, so the game ends immediately.\n\nThus, Alice has one point in total.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndannyboy1204\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BSG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n4015\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-05-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

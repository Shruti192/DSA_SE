b'\n\nGiven a n*n grid with every cell in it consisting of number 1,2 or 3. A person standing at cell (a,b) can go to (c,d) only if (c-a)+(d-b)=1 and c>=a and d>=b.\nThe cost of a walk is the product of all the numbers on the cells visited in that walk.\nNow you have to answer q queries of the form: for each given x, y ->\nYou start at (1,1) and end your walk in the cell (n,n), now you want to know if there is a walk such that its cost is equal to 2x*3y.\n\n\nInput\n\nFirst line will contain n the dimension of the grid.\nNext n ines contain n values each denoting the values in the jth cell of the ith row.\nNext line contains an integer q no of queries.\nNext q lines contains 2 integers x and y denoting the query.\n\nOutput\nFor every query print "YES"(without quotes) if there is a walk with cost 2x*3y and "NO" otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= n <= 18\n1 <= Ai,j <= 3\n1 <= q <= 1000\n1 <= x,y <= 2*n-1\n\nExample\nInput:\n5\n1 2 2 3 1\n1 1 1 2 3\n1 2 3 1 2\n1 2 2 2 2\n3 3 3 3 3\n1\n6 1\n\nOutput:\nYES\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nnpl_nitw\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NPLFLD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 breadth-first-search, dynamic-programming, memoization, npl_nitw, nplq1602\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-10-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

Now, being the PM, he can do one good or bad deed per day. Initially, Chef has a reputation with his cabinet equal to 00; when he does a good deed, his reputation increases by 11 and when he does a bad deed, his reputation decreases by 11.\nChef plans to do exactly pp good deeds and exactly qq bad deeds. However, to do a bad deed, his reputation must be strictly greater than cc (before doing this deed) \xe2\x80\x94 otherwise, he would lose the confidence of his cabinet and be forced to resign.\nDGP Vaibhav has been dealing with corrupt ministers for a long time. In the past, he has arrested MM corrupt ministers. For each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M, when the ii-th minister was arrested, that minister had done gigi good deeds and bibi bad deeds. Over time, Vaibhav has become an expert at detecting and arresting corrupt ministers \xe2\x80\x94 Chef is certain that immediately after he performs exactly gigi good deeds and exactly bibi bad deeds (for some ii between 11 and MM inclusive), he will end up arrested by Vaibhav. Since Chef plans to be a good PM, we may assume he won't be arrested by Vaibhav for any other reason.\nCompute the number of sequences of good and bad deeds Chef can perform in order to execute his plan without getting arrested by Vaibhav or losing the confidence of his cabinet, modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains four space-separated integers pp, qq, cc and MM denoting the total number of good deeds, total number of bad deeds, the reputation threshold and the number of previously arrested ministers.\nEach of the following MM lines contains two space-separated integers gg and bb denoting the number of good deeds and the number of bad deeds of an arrested minister.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of possible sequences modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa43,0001\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa43,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4p,q,c\xe2\x89\xa42,000,0000\xe2\x89\xa4p,q,c\xe2\x89\xa42,000,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4g,b\xe2\x89\xa42,000,0000\xe2\x89\xa4g,b\xe2\x89\xa42,000,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 0\xe2\x89\xa4p,q\xe2\x89\xa42,0000\xe2\x89\xa4p,q\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n\n5 2 2 6\n3 4\n1 5\n4 4\n5 0\n2 2\n5 0\n\nExample Output\n\n4\n\nExplanation\nThere are only 4 ways to do 5 good and 2 bad deeds without losing the cabinet's confidence and without being caught by Vaibhav:\n\n- G G G G B G B\n- G G G G B B G\n- G G G B G G B\n- G G G B G B G\n\nNote\n\n- G G B G G G B is not a valid sequence since after doing G G his reputation\nis just 2 units and committing a B after that him lose the confidence of the\ncabinet.\n- G G G G G B B is not valid since on committing G G G G G Chef will have\ncommitted 5 good deeds and 0 bad deeds which will get him arrested by\nVaibhav.  \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85vaibhav18197\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/VAIMIN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics, Catalan Numbers, Multiplicative Inverse, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2585\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-12-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

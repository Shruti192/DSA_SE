For each valid ii, the weight of the ii-th box is WiWi. Chef wants to bring them to his home, which is at the position 00. He can hold any number of boxes at the same time; however, the total weight of the boxes he's holding must not exceed K at any time, and he can only pick the ith box if all the boxes between Chef's home and the ith box have been either moved or picked up in this trip.\nTherefore, Chef will pick up boxes and carry them home in one or more round trips. Find the smallest number of round trips he needs or determine that he cannot bring all boxes home.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers W1,W2,\xe2\x80\xa6,WNW1,W2,\xe2\x80\xa6,WN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of round trips or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible for Chef to bring all boxes home.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa4103 for each valid ii\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1 1 \n2\n2 4\n1 1\n3 6\n3 4 2\n3 6\n3 4 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-1\n1\n2\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Since the weight of the box higher than KK, Chef can not carry that box home in any number of the round trip.\nExample case 2: Since the sum of weights of both boxes is less than KK, Chef can carry them home in one round trip.\nExample case 3: In the first round trip, Chef can only pick up the box at position 11. In the second round trip, he can pick up both remaining boxes at positions 22 and 33.\nExample case 4: Chef can only carry one box at a time, so three round trips are required.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFNWRK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, ad-hoc, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1185\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

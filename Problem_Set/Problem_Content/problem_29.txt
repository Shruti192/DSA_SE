b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a string SS with length NN. Determine if it is possible to find two non-empty strings AA and BB which satisfy the following conditions:\n\nA+B=SA+B=S, where ++ denotes string concatenation\nBB is a substring of AA\n\nNote: BB is a substring of AA if BB can be obtained from AA by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end. For example, "ab" is a substring of "cabd", but "ad" is not.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains a single string SS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to find strings AA and BB satisfying the given conditions or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|S|=N|S|=N\nSS contains only lowercase English letters\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n6\ncabdab\n21\nyourcrushlovesyouback\n16\nwubbalubbadubdub\n5\nsplit\n7\nsplitit\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can choose "cabd" as AA and "ab" as BB. We can see that A+B=SA+B=S and BB is a substring of AA.\nExample case 2: It is impossible to find two strings which satisfy the constraints. For example, when AA is "yourcrushlovesyou" and BB is "back", then A+B=SA+B=S, but BB is not a substring of AA.\nExample case 3: We can choose "wubbalubbadub" as AA and "dub" as BB.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85sjshohag\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SPLITIT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1251\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nChef prepared two dishes yesterday. Chef had assigned the tastinesstastiness T1T1 and T2T2 to the first and to the second dish respectively. The tastiness of the dishes can be any integerinteger between 00 and NN (both inclusive).\nUnfortunately, Chef has forgotten the values of T1T1 and T2T2 that he had assigned to the dishes. However, he remembers the sum of the tastiness of both the dishes - denoted by SS.\nChef wonders, what can be the maximum possible absolute difference between the tastiness of the two dishes. Can you help the Chef in finding the maximum absolute difference?\nIt is guaranteed that at least one pair {T1,T2}{T1,T2} exist such that T1+T2=S,0\xe2\x89\xa4T1,T2\xe2\x89\xa4NT1+T2=S,0\xe2\x89\xa4T1,T2\xe2\x89\xa4N.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of testcases. The description of the TT testcases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN, SS, denoting the maximum tastiness and the sum of tastiness of the two dishes, respectively.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output a single line containing the maximum absolute difference between the tastiness of the two dishes.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 1\n4 4\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 11: The possible pairs of {T1,T2}{T1,T2} are {0,1}{0,1} and {1,0}{1,0}. Difference in both the cases is 11, hence the maximum possible absolute difference is 11.\nTest Case 22: The possible pairs of {T1,T2}{T1,T2} are {0,4}{0,4}, {1,3}{1,3}, {2,2}{2,2}, {3,1}{3,1} and {4,0}{4,0}. The maximum possible absolute difference is 44.\nTest Case 33: The possible pairs of {T1,T2}{T1,T2} are {1,2}{1,2} and {2,1}{2,1}. Difference in both the cases is 11, and hence the maximum possible absolute difference is 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85lavish315\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAX_DIFF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Optimization Problems, Case work, Conditional Statements, Basic Maths, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1254\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-09-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

After a few days, a citizen complained that there was no way to create an odd value, so Chefu decided that he should also introduce coins with value 11. Formally, you are given an integer NN; for v=1v=1 and each even positive integer v\xe2\x89\xa4Nv\xe2\x89\xa4N, coins with value vv exist.\nYou are also given an integer SS. To handle transactions quickly, find the minimum number of coins needed to pay a price SS.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers SS and NN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of coins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4109\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\nNN is even\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 2\n1 14\n30 10\n31 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One coin with value 22 is sufficient.\nExample case 2: We need to use one coin with value 11.\nExample case 3: We need 33 coins, each with value 1010.\nExample case 4: We can use seven coins with value 44, one coin with value 22 and one coin with value 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dean_student\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFMOT18\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Conditional Statements, Basic Maths, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1250\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

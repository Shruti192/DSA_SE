b'\nToday, Fluffy decided to play with a sequence of integers, a1a1, a2a2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, anan which is coincidentally a permutation of the numbers 11, 22, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, nn. Fluffy thinks that a sequence b1b1, b2b2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, bkbk is alternating if and only if either of the following holds :\n\nFor all ii, bi<bi+1bi<bi+1 if and only if ii is odd\nFor all ii, bi<bi+1bi<bi+1 if and only if ii is even\n\nFor example, 11,44,22,55,33 and 44,11,55,22,33 are both alternating sequences.\nA subsequence of a sequence is a sequence that is formed by deleting zero or more elements of the original sequence. For example, 33, 44, 55 is a subsequence of 11, 33, 22, 44, 77, 66, 55. \nFlippy the bird has asked Fluffy to find the longest alternating subsequence of the array aa, but there are so many of them, so he also wants to know the number of longest alternating subsequences. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer nn, the length of the sequence.\nThe next line contains nn space-separated integers, a1a1, a2a2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, anan. It is guaranteed that these numbers are a permutation of 11, 22, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, nn.\n\nOutput\nOutput two space-separated integers, the length of the longest alternating subsequences and the number of longest alternating subsequences. Since there might be many longest alternating subsequences, output the number of alternating subsequences modulo 109+7109+7\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (13 points) : 1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4201\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa420\nSubtask 2 (23 points) : 1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000\nSubtask 3 (64 points) : No additional constraints\nExample Input\n4\n2 1 3 4\n\nExample Output\n3 2\n\nExplanation\nThere are 22 longest alternating subsequences, which have length 33.

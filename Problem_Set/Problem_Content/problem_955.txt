b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nNo play and eating all day makes your belly fat. This happened to Chef during the lockdown. His weight before the lockdown was w1w1 kg (measured on the most accurate hospital machine) and after MM months of lockdown, when he measured his weight at home (on a regular scale, which can be inaccurate), he got the result that his weight was w2w2 kg (w2>w1w2>w1).\nScientific research in all growing kids shows that their weights increase by a value between x1x1 and x2x2 kg (inclusive) per month, but not necessarily the same value each month. Chef assumes that he is a growing kid. Tell him whether his home scale could be giving correct results.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers w1w1, w2w2, x1x1, x2x2 and MM. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the integer 11 if the result shown by the scale can be correct or 00 if it cannot.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4w1<w2\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4w1<w2\xe2\x89\xa4100\n0\xe2\x89\xa4x1\xe2\x89\xa4x2\xe2\x89\xa4100\xe2\x89\xa4x1\xe2\x89\xa4x2\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa410\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 2 1 2 2\n2 4 1 2 2\n4 8 1 2 2\n5 8 1 2 2\n1 100 1 2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Since the increase in Chef's weight is 2\xe2\x88\x921=12\xe2\x88\x921=1 kg and that is less than the minimum possible increase 1\xe2\x8b\x852=21\xe2\x8b\x852=2 kg, the scale must be faulty.\nExample case 2: Since the increase in Chef's weight is 4\xe2\x88\x922=24\xe2\x88\x922=2 kg, which is equal to the minimum possible increase 1\xe2\x8b\x852=21\xe2\x8b\x852=2 kg, the scale is showing correct results.\nExample case 3: Since the increase in Chef's weight is 8\xe2\x88\x924=48\xe2\x88\x924=4 kg, which is equal to the maximum possible increase 2\xe2\x8b\x852=42\xe2\x8b\x852=4 kg, the scale is showing correct results.\nExample case 4: Since the increase in Chef's weight 8\xe2\x88\x925=38\xe2\x88\x925=3 kg lies in the interval [1\xe2\x8b\x852,2\xe2\x8b\x852][1\xe2\x8b\x852,2\xe2\x8b\x852] kg, the scale is showing correct results.\nExample case 5: Since the increase in Chef's weight is 100\xe2\x88\x921=99100\xe2\x88\x921=99 kg and that is more than the maximum possible increase 2\xe2\x8b\x852=42\xe2\x8b\x852=4 kg, the weight balance must be faulty.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WEIGHTBL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Conditional Statements, Basic Maths, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1045\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-03-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

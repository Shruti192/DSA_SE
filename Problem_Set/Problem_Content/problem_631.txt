b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nRecently, Chef learned how to solve the Longest common subsequence problem. Being a fan of Ekta Kapoor1, he really likes problems which require finding something kth. Please help him solve one such problem he encountered.\n\n\nChef wants to know the lexicographically kth longest common subsequence of any two given strings A and B. In other words, let L be the length of LCS(A, B), S be the sorted set of all common sequences of A and B with length L, you should find Sk. Keep in mind that all elements of a set are distinct.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains two integers n and k. The second line contains the string A, and the third contains the string B. Lengths of both A and B equal n. \n\nOutput\nOutput lexicographically kth longest common subsequence. If such a sequence doesn\'t exist, output -1.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nEach character of A and B is a lowercase Latin letter.\n\nExample\nInput:\n3 3\nabc\ncba\n\nOutput:\nc\n\n\nInput:\n5 5\nabcba\nbacab\n\nOutput:\n-1\n\n\nInput:\n2 2\naa\nab\n\nOutput:\n-1\n\nExplanation:\n\nExample case 1.\nL = LCS(A, B) = 1. There are three common sequences with length L, S = {"a", "b", "c"}. Answer is "c".\n\n\nExample case 2.\nL = LCS(A, B) = 3. There are four common sequences with length L, S = {"aca", "acb", "bca", "bcb"}. Answer is "-1".\n\n\nExample case 3.\nL = LCS(A, B) = 1. There is only one distinct common sequence with length L, S = {"a"}. Answer is "-1".\n\nNote: 1Chef is not really a fan of Ekta Kapoor.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFKLCS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Longest Common Subsequence\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP on sequences\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2761\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-12-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

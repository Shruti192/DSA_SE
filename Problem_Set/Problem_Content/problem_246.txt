b"\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has two matrices AA and BB, each with size N\xc3\x97MN\xc3\x97M. Each cell of the matrix AA contains a character '0' or '1', while each cell of the matrix BB contains '?', '0' or '1'.\nThe matrix AA can be modified using zero or more operations. In one operation, Chef can choose two cells in the matrix AA which lie either in the same row or in the same column and flip the characters in each of these cells (flipping means changing '1' to '0' or '0' to '1').\nChef wants the matrix AA to match the matrix BB. Formally, for each row rr and column cc, if the cell in row rr and column cc of BB contains '0' or '1', then he wants the cell in row rr and column cc of AA to contain the same character; otherwise (for cells containing '?'), it may contain either '0' or '1'.\nThe difficulty of your task is described by a parameter EE. If E=0E=0, you should only find the smallest number of operations required to achieve this goal. If E=1E=1, you should also find one sequence of operations with the smallest length which achieves it.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and EE.\nNN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains a single string AiAi with length MM describing the ii-th row of the matrix AA.\nNN more lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains a single string BiBi with length MM describing the ii-th row of the matrix BB.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is not possible to make AA match BB, print a single line containing the integer \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer KK \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest required number of operations.\nThen, if E=1E=1, print KK lines describing the sequence of operations you want to perform.

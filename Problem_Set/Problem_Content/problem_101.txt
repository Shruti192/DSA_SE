b"\nNathan is preparing for the Dash marathon. He has NN training plans. The ii-th plan has an effectiveness of AiAi, but requires that at least BiBi other training plans must be performed before it. A training plan cannot be repeated. \nIf he performs some K>0K>0 distinct trainings - P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PKP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PK (1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N,Pi\xe2\x89\xa0Pj)(1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N,Pi\xe2\x89\xa0Pj) then his training score is \xe2\x88\x91Kj=1APjK\xe2\x88\x91j=1KAPjK. If Nathan does not perform any training plan (K=0)(K=0), then his score is 00.\nWhat is the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans, if he can perform them in any order?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains NN - the number of training plans.\nThe second line contains NN integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN where AiAi is the effectiveness of the ii-th training plan.\nThe third line contains NN integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN where BiBi is the number of pre-requisite training plans for the ii-th training plan.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, output a single real number - the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans.\nYour answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92610\xe2\x88\x926.\nFormally, let your answer be XX, and the jury's answer be YY.

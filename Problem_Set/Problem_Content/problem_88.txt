b'\nChef found NN magical cards in his drawer. Each card has a number written on each of its faces. He places all the cards on the table in a front face-up manner.\nChef denotes the numbers on the front face by A1,A2,...,ANA1,A2,...,AN and on the back face by B1,B2,...,BNB1,B2,...,BN. Chef can choose some (possibly zero or all) cards and flip them, then he will calculate the bitwise AND of all the numbers currently in a face-up manner.\nNow Chef wonders what is the maximum bitwise AND that he can achieve and what is the minimum number of cards he has to flip to achieve this value. Can you help him find it?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nEach test case contains three lines of input.\nThe first line contains a single integer NN - the number of cards.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,...,ANA1,A2,...,AN - the numbers on the front face of the cards\nThe third line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,...,BNB1,B2,...,BN - the numbers on the back face of the cards\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers, first denoting the maximum bitwise AND possible and second denoting the minimum number of flips required to achieve it.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x921\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x921\nSum of NN over all testcases does not exceeds 105105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n4 6 8\n2 1 2\n3\n0 2 0\n2 0 8\n3\n1 2 1\n2 3 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 2\n0 0\n2 2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: The maximum AND is obtained after flipping the first and third cards achieving a configuration of [2,6,2][2,6,2] which yields a bitwise AND of 22.\nTest case 22: Every possible configuration of the cards yields a bitwise AND equal to 00. So to ensure the minimum number of operations, Chef performs no flip.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85tejas10p\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CRDFLP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bit Manipulation, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2023\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

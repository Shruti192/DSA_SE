Every day, he practices for ICPC (International Chefs' Programming Contest) by solving problems. Today, Chef challenged his brother to solve a certain problem, promising to bake an apple pie for him if he succeeds. Chefu has successfully solved the problem, but can you solve it? \nYou are given an integer sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. In one move, you must select two adjacent elements of this sequence (i.e. AiAi and Ai+1Ai+1 for some valid ii) and swap them. Let's call a sequence orderly if it contains a contiguous subsequence with length at least KK such that all of its elements have identical values. Find the minimum number of moves required to make the given sequence orderly or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK. \nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of moves, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to make the sequence orderly.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4300,0002\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4300,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4300,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4300,000 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa4100N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 1,0001,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n8 3\n1 2 2 1 3 3 2 1\n5 3\n1 1 2 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFCH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 1D Arrays, Greedy, Sorting, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2509\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

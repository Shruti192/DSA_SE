b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nNikki has NN coconuts, she wants to prepare a special coconut soup for her best friend Mansi. In order to make this soup, she has to break ZZ coconuts. For each coconut, there is a fixed number of times Nikki needs to hit it if she wants it to break. Nikki can only hit one coconut at the same time.\nTheir friend Sakshi is a troublemaker. This time, Sakshi shuffled the coconuts in some (unknown) way. You are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN with the following meaning: it is possible to label the coconuts 11 through NN in such a way that for each valid ii, the ii-th coconut needs to be hit exactly AiAi times to break.\nNikki wants to prepare the soup as soon as possible, so she wants to minimise the number of times she has to hit coconuts in the worst case in order to break ZZ coconuts. Formally, she wants to find a strategy of hitting coconuts, possibly depending on which coconuts broke after which hits, such that no matter which coconuts broke and when, it is guaranteed that after HH hits, there will be ZZ broken coconuts, and there is no strategy with smaller HH. Help Nikki find HH \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of hits.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and ZZ.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of hits.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Z\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4Z\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid ii\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85ZN\xe2\x8b\x85Z over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851063\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4500\nZ=1Z=1\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41,000 for each valid ii\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85ZN\xe2\x8b\x85Z over all test cases does not exceed 3,0003,000\n\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 1\n50 55 \n2 1\n40 100\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n55\n80\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Nikki can choose one coconut and try to hit it 5555 times. It will break either after the 5050-th hit or after the 5555-th hit.\nExample case 2: Nikki can choose one coconut and hit it 4040 times. If it does not break, the other coconut must be the one that takes 4040 hits to break, so she should hit the other coconut 4040 times. In total, she needs to hit coconuts at most 8080 times.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85iamabjain\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CCC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Advanced DP, Convex Hull\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Polygons\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2491\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-06-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

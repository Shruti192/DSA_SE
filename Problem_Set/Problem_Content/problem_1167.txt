b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nIn mathematical terms, the sequence F[N] of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation F[N] = F[N-1] + F[N-2], with seed values F[1] = 1,F[2] = 1.\nToday, Chef gives you a rooted tree, consisting of N nodes. At first, the node 1 is the root. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N, and each node has an integer that initially equals to 0. Then, Chef asks you to perform M queries. \nThe queries are as follows:\n\n\n\nA x y\n\nAdd F[1] to the integer, associated with the node x, then add F[2] to the integer, associated with the second node on the way from x to y, then add F[3] to the integer, associated with the third node on the way from x to y, and so on. As you know, there is only one simple path from x to y.\n\n\n\nQS x y\n\nLet node x be the root of the tree, output the sum of all integers, associated with the nodes in the subtree of the node y, modulo 1000000009(109+9).\n\n\n\nQC x y\n\nOutput the sum of all the integers, associated with the nodes on the way from x to y, modulo 1000000009(109+9).\n\n\n\nR x\n\nAll the integers associated with the nodes return to the state after the x-th query. If x is 0, then all of them become equal to 0, as in the very beginning.\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input consists of two space separated intergers - N and M respectively.\nThen, N-1 lines follow. These N-1 lines describe the tree structure. Each line consists of two intergers - x and y, and that means that there is an edge between the node x and the node y.\nThen, M lines follow. Every single line denotes a single query, which has one of the following forms: (See the sample for the detailed explanation)\n\n\nA x1 y\n\n\n\n\nQS x1 y\n\n\n\n\nQC x1 y\n\n\n\n\nR x1\n\n\n \nAs you can see, the number x isn't given to you directly. For all queries, actual number x will be equal to x1 xor lastans, where lastans denotes the last number that you have output, or 0 if you haven't output any numbers yet.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nFor each query of the type QS or QC, output the answer modulo 109+9\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x, y \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n5 6\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\nA 4 2\nA 2 5\nQS 4 3\nQC 12 4\nR 6\nQC 6 4\n\nOutput:\n13\n7\n4\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s denote the first state of integers as 0 0 0 0 0, where the i-th interger means the integer associated with the node i.\nIn the first query \xe2\x80\x9cA 4 2\xe2\x80\x9d, the actual number is x = 4 xor 0 = 4. Hence the state will be 2 3 1 1 0 after this query.\nAfter the second query \xe2\x80\x9cA 2 5\xe2\x80\x9d, the state will be 3 4 3 1 3 for the similar reason.\nIn the next query, the answer is 3+4+3+3=13.\nIn the next query, the actual number is x = 12 xor 13 = 1, the answer is 3+3+1=7.\nIn the query \xe2\x80\x9cR 6\xe2\x80\x9d, the actual number is x = 6 xor 7 = 1, the state will be roll backed to 2 3 1 1 0.\nAt last, the actual number is x = 6 xor 7 = 1, the answer is 2+1+1=4.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dzy493941464\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FIBTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Persistent Structures, Segment Trees, HLD, Fibonacci Series\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Mathematics, Sequences and Progression\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3023\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-06-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

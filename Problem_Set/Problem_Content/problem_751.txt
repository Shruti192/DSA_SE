She put Jack in a grid with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and MM columns (numbered 11 through MM). There are KK cheese wedges scattered over the grid; for each wedge, we know how long it takes Jack to eat it.\nLet's denote the cell in row rr and column cc by (r,c)(r,c). Initially, Jack is in the cell (1,1)(1,1). When Jack is in a cell (r,c)(r,c), he can move to either of the cells (r,c\xe2\x88\x921)(r,c\xe2\x88\x921) or (r,c+1)(r,c+1) in 11 second. If he is in the first or last column of the grid (c=1c=1 or c=Mc=M), he can also move to the cell (r+1,c)(r+1,c) in 11 second. Jack can only eat a cheese wedge if he is in the same cell as the wedge.\nYour task is to help Jack find out, for each possible ii, the minimum number of seconds Jack needs to eat ii cheese wedges.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and KK.\nKK lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers rr, cc and tt, denoting that there is a cheese wedge in cell (r,c)(r,c) and it takes Jack tt seconds to eat it.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing KK space-separated integers. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K), the ii-th of them should denote the minimum number of seconds Jack needs to eat ii cheese wedges.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41093\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N\n2\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x88\x9212\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x88\x921\n1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4109\nno two cheese wedges are in the same cell\nthe sum of KK over all test cases does not exceed 104104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\nN,M,K\xe2\x89\xa4300N,M,K\xe2\x89\xa4300\n\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 10 5\n1 2 10\n2 2 1\n1 3 1\n1 9 1 \n2 9 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 8 14 22 32\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85watcher\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MMC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2678\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

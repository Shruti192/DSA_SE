b"\n\xc2\xa0\n\nFluffy the squirrel has a robot that is standing on some square (i, j) of an m times n grid. Fluffy can give the robot a command of length k, which consists of the letters R, L, D or U. The top left square is (1, 1) while the bottom right square is (n, m). If the robot receives a command R, then it moves one square to the right. Similarly, U, D, L stands for up, down and left respectively.\n\nSome squares of the grid are filled with lava, which will melt the robot if it ever goes into that square. So, a sequence of command is called valid if the robot never moves into a square filled with lava or outside the grid. For each square (x, y), Fluffy wants to know the number of valid commands that will take the robot there. Can you help him?\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line contains three space-seperated integers, n, m, k, the dimensions of the grid and the length of the command. The next n lines contain m characters each. The characters represent the grid. '.' represents an empty square, '#' represents a square filled with lava and 'R' represents the robot's starting position. It is guaranteed that 'R' appears exactly once in the input.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOutput n lines, each consisting of m space-seperated integers. The j-th integer of the i row denotes the number of ways to get to (i, j) from the robot's starting position with a valid command of length k, modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, m \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (38 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nSubtask 2 (62 points) : Original Constraints\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3 5 3\n###..\n#.#R.\n....#\nOutput:\n0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5\n0 1 0 4 0\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case. We'll just take a look at the ways to reach (3, 4). There are 4 ways to do that. The sequence of commands RLD, UDD, DUD, DLR works. Note that DRR and DDU are invalid because the former walks the robot into lava while the latter moves the robot out of the grid.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85zscoder\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MCO16402\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy, zscoder\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-11-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef loves to prepare delicious dishes. He has prepared N dishes numbered from 1 to N for this year's MasterChef contest. He has presented all the N dishes to a panel of judges. Judging panel consists of M judges numbered from 1 to M. Rating for each dish was decided by voting from all the judges. Rating for the dishes has been given by a 1-indexed array A where Ai denotes rating of the ith dish.\nSome dishes prepared by chef are extraordinary delicious, but unfortunately, some are not. Chef has been given a chance to improve the total rating of his dishes. By total rating of dishes, we mean the sum of the ratings of his dishes. Each of the M judges has administrative power to remove some (zero or more) dishes from a specified range. The ith judge takes Ci rupees for removing each dish of Chef's choice from the dishes numbered from Li to Ri (both inclusive). Once a dish is removed by any of the M judges it will not be considered for calculating total rating of the dishes. Chef has spent a large portion of his money preparing mouth watering dishes and has only K rupees left for now. Now chef is worried about maximizing total rating of his dishes by dropping some of the N dishes.\nPlease Help chef by finding the maximum total rating he can achieve such that the total expenditure does not exceed his budget of K rupees.\n Input \n\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case contains three space separated integers N, K and M denoting the number of dishes prepared by chef, chef's budget, and number of judges in judging panel respectively.\nNext line of each test case contains N space separated integers where ith integer denotes the rating received by the ith dish.\nNext M lines of each test case contain three space separated integers each: L, R and C, where the integers in the ith line denotes the value of Li, Ri and Ci respectively.\n\nOutput \nFor each test case, print a single integer in a line corresponding to the answer.\n Constraints \n\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N,M \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 500 \n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Li \xe2\x89\xa4 Ri \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ci \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n -109 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n Sum of N and M over all test cases does not exceed 5*105\n\n Subtasks : \n\nSubtask 1 : Sum of all N's across the test cases in a file does not exceed 5000.

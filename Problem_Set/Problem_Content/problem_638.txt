b'\n\nGiven a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.\nnumber of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.\nThe answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFor every test case it contains two number N and Q.\nNext Q line contains two number I and K.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case print required answer.\n\nConstraints and Subtasks:\n\n1<=T<=5\n1<=N, K<=4000\n1<=Q<=1000000\n\nSubtask 3: 5 points\n\n1<=T<=5\n1<=N, K<=16\n1<=Q<=1000\n\nSubtask 1: 25 points\n\nT=1\n1<=N, K<=4000\n1<=Q<=100000\n\nSubtask 2: 70 points\n\nOriginal Constraints.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n1\n3 3\n1 2\n2 1\n3 2\n\nOutput:\n0\n 2\n2\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor N=3\ntotal subsets are:\n{1}\n{2}\n{3}\n{1,2}\n{1,3}\n{2,3}\n{1,2,3}\nNow we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.\nFor 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.\nSame for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85adi28galaxyak\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDVA1607\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 adi28galaxyak, cdva16, combinatorics, dynamic-programming, easy-medium, modulo\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef likes to play with trees a lot, so his best friend Smurf has given him a tree T consisting of N nodes numbered from 1 to N. \nSmurf asked him to count the number of ways to assign an integer in the range [1, M] to each of the nodes of the tree such that the absolute difference between the integers assigned to any pair of adjacent nodes is greater or equal than K (i. e \xe2\x89\xa5 K). Since this number can be huge, Chef only needs to find it modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007)\nOf course this task is tough for our little chef and he cannot solve it without your help. Can you help him?\nInput\nThe first line of input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases. \nThe first line of each test case contains three space separated integers denoting N, M and K, denoting the number of nodes in the tree and the values of M and K respectively. \nThe following (N-1) lines of each test case contain two space separated integers u and v denoting that there is an edge between the nodes u and v.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the answer in a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (20 pts) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 102\nSubtask 2 (30 pts) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 104\nSubtask 3 (50 pts) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nExample\nInput\n3\n2 2 0\n1 2\n3 3 2\n1 3\n1 2\n3 3 1\n1 2\n2 3\n\nOutput\n4\n2\n12\n\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85ma5termind\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LABEL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, DP on Trees, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2958\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-04-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

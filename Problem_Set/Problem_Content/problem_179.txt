b'\nGiven a Matrix  of size NXNNXN you have to reach the middle point of the matrix by breaking all the boundaries from any one  point i.e. any no on (i,j) of boundary or the perimeter in one box.\nIf you break any one element on a boundary then you can directly go to the next inner boundary or inner box then you have to break this box and further move in until you have reached the middle of the square matrix.\nIf the side of the square matrix is odd then you have to break this middle element too. \nEach element of this matrix has a particular energy that is consumed in breaking this element. Now tell me what is the minimum energy consumed in moving to its middle.  Square Matrix has side NN.\nBoundaries in matrix can be created as follow:\n\nfor this case: ans=1+2ans=1+2\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NN, side of the square. Then the testcases follow. \nA matrix of size NN*NN . containing integer values AiAi\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer the minimum energy required to reach the centre.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4100000001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410000000\n\nSample Input:\n3\n2   2    4  \n5   20   4\n1   2    1\n\nSample Output:\n21\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFirst We will break outer box from 1 then inner box with energy 20 so total energy consumed is 1+20=21.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85aayushindwan\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BOXINBOX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aayushindwan, ad-hoc, greedy, strt2020\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-02-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

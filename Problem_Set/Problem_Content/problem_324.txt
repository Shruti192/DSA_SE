b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nYou are given a string S of length N consisting only of 0s and 1s. You are also given an integer K.\nYou have to answer Q queries. In the ith query, two integers Li and Ri are given. Then you should print the number of substrings of S[L, R] which contain at most K 0s and at most K 1s where S[L, R] denotes the substring from Lth to Rth characters of the string S. \nIn other words, you have to count number of pairs (i, j) of integers such that L \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 j \xe2\x89\xa4 R such that no character in substring S[i, j] occurs more than K times.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and Q as described in the problem. The second line contains a string S of length N. Then the next Q lines describe the query, where the ith line of them contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.\nOutput\nFor each query, print the required answer in a single line.\nConstraints and Subtasks\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Li \xe2\x89\xa4 Ri \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nSum of N over all test cases in one test file does not exceed 105\nSum of Q over all test cases in one test file does not exceed 105\nS consists only of 0s and 1s.\nSubtask 1: 10 points\nSum of N over all test cases in one test file does not exceed 100\nSubtask 2: 10 points\nQ = 1\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 min(5, N)\nSubtask 3: 20 points\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nSubtask 4: 60 points\nOriginal constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n8 2 3\n01110000\n1 4\n2 4\n5 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n5\n7\n\n\nExplanation\nQuery 1: Consider substring P = S[1, 4] = "0111".Out of 10 total substrings of P, substrings P[1, 4] and P[2, 4] are not valid because both contain more than two 1s. Other substrings contains at most two 0s and at most two 1s, thus the answer is 8.\nQuery 2: Consider substring P = S[2, 4] = "111".Out of 6 total substrings of P, substrings P[1, 3] is  not valid because it contains more than two 1s.\nQuery 3: Consider substring P = S[5, 8] = "0000".Out of 10 total substrings of P, substrings P[1, 3], P[1, 4] and P[2, 4] are not valid because all contain more than two 0s.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85darkshadows\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STRSUB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Segment Trees, Pre processing, Bottom-up, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2105\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-04-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

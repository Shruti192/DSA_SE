b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a strictly convex polygon with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the coordinates of the ii-th vertex are (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi). You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):\n\nConsider a parent polygon. Initially, this is the polygon you are given.\nDraw one of its child polygons \xe2\x80\x95 a simple non-degenerate polygon such that each of its sides is a chord of the parent polygon (it cannot be a side of the parent polygon). The operation cannot be performed if the parent polygon does not have any child polygons.\nThe child polygon which you drew becomes the new parent polygon.\n\nYour goal is to draw as many sides of polygons in total as possible (including the polygon given at the start). Find this maximum total number of sides.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nNN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers XiXi and YiYi.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum possible number of sides of polygons.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41053\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|Xi|,|Yi|\xe2\x89\xa4109|Xi|,|Yi|\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851062\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n-100 1\n0 2\n0 0\n100 1\n7\n-4 0\n-3 -2\n-3 2\n0 -4\n2 -3\n2 3\n3 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n10\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: It is not possible to draw a child polygon.\nExample case 2: We can draw a child polygon once, e.g. with vertices (\xe2\x88\x923,\xe2\x88\x922)(\xe2\x88\x923,\xe2\x88\x922), (\xe2\x88\x923,2)(\xe2\x88\x923,2) and (3,2)(3,2). Even though there are several other ways to draw a child polygon, it can only be a triangle, so the total number of sides cannot exceed 7+3=107+3=10.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85pandey__ji\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/POLYREL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Geometry, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1460\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

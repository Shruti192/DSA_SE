b'\n\xc2\xa0\nCaptain America has requested Tony for a new shield with a different shape to experiment with. Tony decided that he will build a triangular shield for Captain. He first decided to build the traingular frame of the shield. To do so, he has n segments of Vibranium steel alloy, the i-th of them has a length Ai. Since Vibranium is a rare substance, Tony can use exactly 3 segments out of n, such that they form a non degenerate triangular frame. He can not concatenate two segments or change the length of any segment. Help Tony determine if he can use exactly three segments to form a triangular frame or not !!\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a positive integer t, denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of segments Tony has to choose from.\nThe second line of each test case contains n space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the length of the segments. \n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in a single line "Yes" if Tony can form a non-degenerate triangular frame using exactly three segments, and "No" otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n5\n1 2 3 5 2\n3\n2 4 1\n\nOutput:\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85varuns_2729\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CAPTAIN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, constructive, greedy, sorting, varuns_2729\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-04-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

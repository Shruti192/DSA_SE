b"\nRead problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN buckets numbered 11 through NN. The buckets contain balls; each ball has a color between 11 and KK. Let's denote the number of balls with color jj that are initially in bucket ii by ai,jai,j.\nFor each ii from 11 to N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 (in this order), someone draws a ball uniformly at random from bucket ii and puts it into bucket i+1i+1, then continues to draw the next ball. After putting a ball in bucket NN, this person draws a ball, again uniformly at random, from bucket NN.\nFor each color from 11 to KK, find the probability that the ball drawn from bucket NN has this color.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and KK. \nNN lines follow. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the ii-th of these lines contains KK space-separated integers ai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,Kai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,K.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing KK space-separated real numbers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these numbers should denote the probability that the last drawn ball has color ii. your answer will be considered correct if absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92610\xe2\x88\x926\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4100\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa410 for each valid i,ji,j\ninitially, there is at least one ball in bucket 11\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 2\n0 1\n1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0.333333 0.666667\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85arpa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BUCKETS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Probability, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1871\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-12-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nChampak is a bright student who is very fond of clocks. \nHe comes across a puzzle which states that he needs to calculate the number of times the minute hand and hour hand of a clock will make a 90o90o degrees angle between them.\nHe is given TT such queries with time range from LL hours to RR hours (both inclusive in the 2424-hour format) like [L,R][L,R].\nHe has to count the number of times the clock will have a right angle between the hour hand and the minute hand in the given time range.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain an integer TT, number of queries. Then the queries follow. \nEach query contains of a single line of input, two integers L,RL,R. \n\nOutput:\nFor each query, output in a single line the number of times the hour hand and the minute hand make a right angle between them from LL hours to RR hours (both inclusive).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4240\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa424\n\nSample Input:\n6\n3 5\n0 2\n5 8\n16 20\n7 7\n15 21\n\nSample Output:\n4\n4\n6\n8\n0\n12\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor the second query, the hour hand and the minute hand will make right angles between them 44 times, twice between 00 to 11 hours and twice between 11 to 22 hours.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85zappelectro\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COCR105\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cros2020, math, zappelectro\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nChef is again playing a game with his best friend Garry. As usual, the rules of this game are extremely strange and uncommon.\nFirst, they are given a stack of NN discs. Each disc has a distinct, non-negative integer written on it. The players exchange turns to make a move. Before the start of the game, they both agree upon a set of positive integers  SS of size KK. It is guaranteed that S contains the integer 11. In a move, a player can select any value xx from SS and pop exactly xx elements from the top of the stack. The game ends when there are no discs remaining. Chef goes first.\nScoring: For every disc a player pops, his score increases by 2p2p where pp is the integer written on the disc. For example, if a player pops the discs, with integers p1,p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pmp1,p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pm written on it, during the entire course of the game, then his total score will be 2p1+2p2+2p3+\xe2\x8b\xaf+2pm2p1+2p2+2p3+\xe2\x8b\xaf+2pm.\nThe player with higher score wins the game. Determine the winner if both the players play optimally, or if the game ends in a draw.\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains TT, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers NN and KK, denoting the size of the stack and the set S respectively.\nNext line contains NN space separated integers AiAi where A1A1 is the topmost element, denoting the initial arrangement of the stack.\nThe last line of each test case contains KK space separated integers each denoting xixi.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output "Chef" (without quotes) if Chef wins, "Garry" (without quotes) if Garry wins, otherwise "Draw" (without quotes) in a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(100,N)1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(100,N)\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4N\nxi\xe2\x89\xa0xjxi\xe2\x89\xa0xj for all i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0j\nAi\xe2\x89\xa0AjAi\xe2\x89\xa0Aj for all i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0j\nSet SS contains integer 11. \nSum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105.\n\nSample Input:\n1\n3 2\n5 7 1\n1 2\n\nSample Output:\nChef\n\nExplanation:\nChef can select 2 from the set and draw the top two discs (with integers 5 and 7 written on it) from the stack. Garry cannot select 2 from the set as there is only 1 disc left in the stack. However, he can select 1 from the set and pop the last disc.\nSo, Chef\'s score = 2525 + 2727 = 160160\nGarry\'s score = 2121 = 22\nChef wins.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85sarthakmanna\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Game Theory, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2396\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

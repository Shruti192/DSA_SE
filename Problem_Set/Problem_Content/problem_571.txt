b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a tree with N nodes. Each node of the tree has an integer weight associated with it.\nLet's define the cost of a sequence of numbers as the arithmetic mean of all elements of the sequence.\nNext, let's define the cost of a path in the tree as the cost of the sequence of weights of all nodes belonging to the path. (It's possible for a path to contain only one node.)\nA set of paths in the tree is called a correct path decomposition if each node of the tree belongs to exactly one of the paths from this set. The cost of a correct decomposition is defined as the minimum of costs of all paths in this decomposition.\nChef would like to find the maximum cost of a correct decomposition. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the weights of nodes of the tree.\nEach of the following N-1 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting an edge between nodes x and y.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the maximum possible cost among all correct decompositions. You answer will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed 10-6.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 200,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (15 points, time limit 1 second):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over all testcases \xe2\x89\xa4 400 \nfor each i (1 < i \xe2\x89\xa4 N), there is an edge connecting nodes i and i-1\n\n\n\nSubtask #2 (35 points, time limit 1 second):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 400\n\n\n\nSubtask #3 (50 points, time limit 3 seconds): original constraints\n\nExample\nInput:\n\t\n2\n2\n2 3\n1 2\n5\n4 3 5 2 1\n5 3\n1 3\n2 1\n3 4\n\nOutput:\n\n2.5000000\n2.6666667\n\n Explanation \n\nExample case 1: It's better to use one path containing both nodes (blue in the picture above) rather than keep each node in a separate one-node path, since the first way gives decomposition cost equal to (A1 + A2) / 2 = (2+3) / 2 = 2.5, while the second one gives decomposition cost min(A1 / 1, A2 / 1) = min(2 / 1, 3 / 1) = 2.\nExample case 2: It's optimal to decompose the tree into three paths (coloured red, green and yellow in the picture). This way, the red path has cost (A3 + A4 + A5) / 3 = (5 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.6666667, the green path has cost A1 = 4 and the yellow path has cost A2 = 3. Thus, the cost of this decomposition is 2.6666667.\nIt's possible to merge the green and yellow paths into one path with cost 3.5 without changing the decomposition cost. Any other decomposition has smaller cost.\nNote: The multiplier for Python has been decreased from 5 to 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kefaa\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/L56AVG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP on Trees, DFS, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2789\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

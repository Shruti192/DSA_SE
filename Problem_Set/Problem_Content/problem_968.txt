b'\nChef discovered that his secret recipe has been stolen. He immediately informs the police of the theft.\nIt is known that the policeman and thief move on the number line. You are given that:\n\nThe initial location of the policeman on the number line is XX and his speed is 22 units per second.\nThe initial location of the thief on the number line is YY and his speed is 11 unit per second.\n\nFind the minimum time (in seconds) in which the policeman can catch the thief. Note that, the policeman catches the thief as soon as their locations become equal and the thief will try to evade the policeman for as long as possible.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer TT \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers XX and YY, as described in the problem statement. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the minimum time taken by the policeman to catch the thief. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4105\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 3\n2 1\n1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: The initial locations of the policeman and thief are 11 and 33 respectively. The minimum time taken by the policeman to catch the thief is 22 seconds, and this happens when both the policeman and the thief move towards the right.  \nTest case 22: The initial location of the policeman and thief are 22 and 11 respectively. The minimum time taken by the policeman to catch the thief is 11 second, and this happens when both the policeman and the thief move towards the left.  \nTest case 33: The initial locations of the policeman and thief are 11 and 11 respectively. Because the police is already present at the location of thief, the time taken by police to catch the thief is 00 seconds.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nlavish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/POLTHIEF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, lavish_adm, math, start35\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n639\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

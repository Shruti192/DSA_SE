b'\n Chef is a very thrilling person. He always tries risky task. One fine day his friend told him that there is a treasure in an island called Trap of Death. After listening to his friend he immediately start his journey towards the island. He passed all the challenges before him. But the last stage is way more dangerous than he thought. In this stage there is a NNxNN matrix of tiles between treasure and Chef. He needs to step forward very carefully because one wrong step may cause death.If we consider NNxNN matrix, initially chef is at position (1,1)(1,1) and treasure is kept at position (N,N)(N,N) (rows and columns are numbered from 1 to N inclusive). \n There are two instructions to pass the matrix of tiles. \n\n 1. Chef can only move down and right in the matrix of tiles.\n \t 2. All the tiles are either black or white. Chef can step only upon whitewhite tiles. If he step upon blackblack tiles, he will die.For sake of convenience, white and black tiles are denoted by 00 and 11. \n For example : \n\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n3. There is number written on every tiles called weight of tiles. Chef needs to step in such a way that at the end of journey the sum of stepped weight of tiles is minimum possible.\n\n\n\n2\n1\n9\n3\n\n\n4\n2\n7\n8\n\n\n5\n2\n1\n4\n\n\n6\n8\n6\n3\n\n\n\n\nIn the given example, the possible paths are  (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(3,4),(4,4)(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(3,4),(4,4) and (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(4,4)(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(4,4). Sum of weights in first path and second path are 2020 and 2222. Chef will have to follow the minimum weight sum path, in this case first path will give minimum weight sum.\n\n Input \n\n The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \n The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the matrices. \n First N lines will follow the weights matrix WW, WijWij denotes the  weight of the ijijth tile, where ii denotes ithith row and jj denotes jthjth column. \n Another N lines will follow matrix PP. PijPij element denotes  whether the ijijth tile is black or white. "1" denotes black tile and "0" denotes white tile, where ii denotes ithith row and jj denotes jthjth column. \n\n\n  Output \n\nOutput will contain two space separated string "Yes" and integer minimum weighted path sum  if there is a possible path or print "No" if there isn\'t a path. \n\n\n Constraints \n\n 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100 \n 2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4500 \n 0\xe2\x89\xa4Wij\xe2\x89\xa41050\xe2\x89\xa4Wij\xe2\x89\xa4105 \n 0\xe2\x89\xa4Pij\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x89\xa4Pij\xe2\x89\xa41 \n\n\n Example input : \n2\n4\n7 4 3 6\n4 2 6 4\n6 6 0 9\n2 93 4 9\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0 \n1 1 0 0\n3\n1 2 5\n3 7 8\n1 2 3\n0 0 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n\n\n Example output \n \n   No\n   Yes 15\n  \n\n Example case 1 : \nThere is no white tiles path from position (1,1)(1,1) to position (N,N)(N,N). \n Example case 2 : \n There is four possible paths - \n\n Path 1 : (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3). Weighted sum of path is 2121 \n Path 2 : (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3).

Weighted sum of path is 1616 \n\n In this case minimum weighted sum is 15. \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85dshahid380_\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MDSC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dshahid380_, dynamic-programming, enja2019, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

Each bulb can be in one of the states "on" or "off". Initially, all the bulbs are "off". Each bulb is also connected to its (at most two) adjacent bulbs by wires.\nYou should reach a state described by a given a binary string SS with length NN \xe2\x80\x95 for each valid ii, if the ii-th character of SS is \'1\', the ii-th bulb should be "on", and if it is \'0\', the ii-th bulb should be "off". You may do that by performing the following steps in the given order:\n\nCut up to KK of the N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 wires between adjacent bulbs (possibly none of them).\nSwitch on some bulbs (possibly none). Here, whenever two bulbs are still connected by wires (directly or indirectly) and one of them gets switched on, then the other one also gets switched on.\nDisconnect some bulbs from the electrical network. Here, disconnecting a bulb switches it off, but it does not affect any other bulbs \xe2\x80\x95 if a bulb was switched on before this step and it was not disconnected in this step, it remains switched on afterwards.\n\nMinimise the number of bulbs you need to disconnect in step 3 in order to reach the given final state of the bulbs.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.\nThe second line contains a single string SS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of bulbs you need to disconnect.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa41050\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|S|=N|S|=N\nSS contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 2\n01001\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can cut the wires between pairs of bulbs (2,3)(2,3) and (4,5)(4,5), switch on bulbs 11, 22 and 55, and then disconnect bulb 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85manishtanwar\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BULBS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Arithmetic, Greedy, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Mathematics, Basic Maths, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2116\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-09-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

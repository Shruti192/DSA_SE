b"\nGiven is an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There may be self loops and/or multiple edges in the graph.\n\nA u-v walk is defined as a sequence of vertices starting at u and ending at v, where consecutive vertices in the sequence are adjacent vertices in the graph i.e. consecutive vertices are connected by some edge.\n\n\nAn arbitary walk of length k+1 is, V1,E1,V2,E2,V3,...,Vk,Ek,V(k+1). where Vi and V(i+1) are connected by edge Ei with weigth Ci.\n\n In simpler informal words, walk is a path in a graph with no restriction\non the number of times you can visit a vertex or edge. \n\nFor such walk we define magic to be, \nmagic(walk) = (C1 & C2) ^ (C2 & C3) ^ ... ^ (C(k-1) & C(k)) if k >= 2\nmagic(walk) = 0 if k < 2\n\nNote: Here Ci (1 <= i <= k) are the corresponding edge weights.\n\n\nWe love magic, don't we? Hence we always want to maximize it. But for a given graph, there are infinite different walks possible. So, you need to think smart and write a program which prints the maximum magic which can be achieved for some walk in the given graph.\n\n\nHere, ' & ' is Binary AND Operator, ' ^ ' is Binary XOR Operator.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains two integers n and m. \nNext m lines, each contain three space separated integers u,v and c denoting an undirected edge in graph between vertices u and v with weight c. \nOutput\nPrint the maximum magic that can be achieved for some walk in the graph.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= n <= 100 \n1 <= m <= 150 \n0 <= c <= 100 \n1 <= u,v <= n \n\nSample Input 1:\n2 1\n1 2 5Sample Output 1:\n5\nExplanation:\nLet the walk be 1->2->1\nFor this walk, magic = (5 & 5) = 5\nSample Input 2:\n4 4\n1 2 1\n2 4 3\n3 1 4\n4 3 2\nSample Output 2:\n7\nExplanation: \nNumber the 4 vertices in input as 1,2,3,4.\nNumber the 4 edges in input as a,b,c,d.\nLet weight of any edge x be |x|.\nFor walk = {1,c,3,c,1,a,2,b,4,d,3}\nmagic = (|c| & |c|) ^ (|c| & |a|) ^ (|a| ^ |b|) ^ (|b| ^ |d|) \n= (4 & 4) ^ (4 & 1) ^ (1 & 3) ^ (3 & 2)\n= 4 ^ 0 ^ 1 ^ 2 = 7\nIt can be proven that 7 is maximum value magic can take for this input.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nskullcrackers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAXMAGIC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 depth-first-search, dynamic-programming, graphs, ipc151a, ipcquestion, skullcrackers\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-10-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\n\nBilbo is planning his eleventy first birthday. Yes, he will soon be 111 years old. He has to decide whom all to invite to the Party. There are N families in the Shire (numbered 1 to N), and some families hate others. For example, the Bagginses of Bag End are on bad terms with the Sackville Bagginses. Each family declares which among the N families do they hate the most (we call this simply the "enemy" of the family).\n\n\nGiven the N enemies of each of the N families, Bilbo is interested in how many ways can he invite people to his party, such that he does not simultaneously invite some family as well as its enemy. Since the number may be large, output the answer modulo 1000000007. Two ways are considered different if the set of families invited differ.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of the number of test-cases, T. \nEach test case begins with a line having a single integer N. \nThis is followed by a line having N integers: denoting the enemies of each of the N families.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test-case, output the number of ways modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\nConstraints\n\n T \xe2\x89\xa4 10 \n 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n No family is "enemies" with itself \n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n4\n2 3 4 1\n3\n2 1 2\n2\n2 1\n\nOutput:\n7\n5\n3\nExplanation\n\nThe first test case: {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1,3}, {2,4}\n\n\nThe second test case: {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,3}\n\n\nThe third test case: {}, {1}, {2}\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nprad_adm\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85tuananh93\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INVITES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP on Trees, Dynamic Programming, Cycles\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2562\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-06-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n10 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  , Russian and Vietnamese\n\nIn a tree, a node having degree \xe2\x89\xa5 3 is said to be a nice node. \nFor tree T, it\'s niceness is defined by the pseudo code given below.\n\n\nint niceness(Tree T):\n\tans = 0;\n\twhile (T is not empty):\n\t\tIdentify all the nice nodes.\n\t\tRemove all nodes of T which have a path to \n\t\ta leaf not passing through any nice node.\n\t\tans++;\n\treturn ans;\t\t\n\n\n\n\ne.g. niceness of the below given tree is 2. In the first iteration of while loop, the nodes marked with green color will be removed. In the second iteration remaining blue marked nodes will be removed. Now, tree will be empty.\n\n\n\n\nGiven two integers N and \xce\xbc. Find out whether there exists a tree of N nodes having niceness \xce\xbc. Output your answer as "Yes" or "No" (without quotes).\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains two space separated integers denoting N and \xce\xbc respectively.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output "Yes" or "No" (without quotes).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 \xce\xbc \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nSum of N over all the test cases in a single file will not exceed 106.\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\n4 1\n5 2\n2 2\n8 2\n\nOutput:\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example, consider the tree which is just a path. It will have niceness of 1.\nIn the second example, following given star graph will have niceness equal to 2.\n\nIn the third example, there is only one tree of 2 nodes and it has a niceness of 1, so there does not exist a tree of 2 nodes with niceness equal to 2.\nIn the last example, tree image given in the problem gives one such tree with niceness of 2.\nNote\nAn empty tree is one which has no nodes.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NICENESS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 admin2, greedy, snck15fl\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-06-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

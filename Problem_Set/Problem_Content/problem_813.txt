b'\nYou are given an undirected tree with n nodes numbered from 1 to n and m weighted tree paths.\nIf two tree paths share at least one common node, they are forbidden to be selected together, that is, only non-intersecting tree paths are allowed to be selected\nYour task is to select a set of tree paths such that the sum of their weights is maximized.\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the first line contains n indicating the number of nodes. \nFollowing n-1 lines describe the tree. Each line contains two integer a, b, which represents an edge between node a and node b.\nThe next line contains an integer m, the number of the tree paths.\nNext m lines contains three integers a, b, c, (a!=b), which represents a tree path from node a to node b and its weight is c.\n\nOutput\nOutput T lines in total. Each line starts with "Case #: " and followed by the maximum sum of weights. Here "#" is the number of the test case starting from 1.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, m \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a, b \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 c \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n7\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 7\n3\n4 7 10\n2 5 6\n6 7 5\n\nOutput:\nCase 1: 11\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ACM14KP4\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 acmkgp14, admin, dynamic-programming, fenwick-tree, medium-hard, segment-tree\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-09-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

Since today is Eid, Chef is going to give one coin to each of his two children. He wants the absolute value of the difference between the values of coins given to the two children to be as small as possible, so that he would be as fair as possible. \nHelp Chef by telling him the minimum possible difference between the values of the coins given to the two children. Of course, Chef cannot give the same coin to both children.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vNv1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible difference.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nthe sum of NN in all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): the sum of NN in all test cases does not exceed 2,0002,000\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1 4 2\n3\n1 3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef gives the coin with value 11 to his first child and the coin with value 22 to the second child, so the answer is 2\xe2\x88\x921=12\xe2\x88\x921=1.\nExample case 2: Chef gives each of his children a coin with value 33, so the difference is 00.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EID\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1135\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

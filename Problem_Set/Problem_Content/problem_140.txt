b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nYou are given an undirected compete graph with n nodes.\nEach edge can be one of n*(n-1)/2 +1 different colors.\nThese colors are labeled from 0 to n*(n-1)/2, inclusive. But not all these n*(n-1)/2 +1 colors need to be used. ie. it is possible that two different edges could have the same color.\nFormally, let ci,j denote the color between the i-th and j-th nodes.\n(Note that these edges are undirected, so ci,j = cj,i).\nWe will define ci,i to be zero, although there is no such  edge present. i.e. the graph does not contain self-loops.\n\n\nA subset of nodes is called interesting if every node in the subset has at least two edges of different colors, connecting it to vertices in the subset.\n\n\nYour task is to determine the maximum possible size of an interesting subset of nodes.\n\n\nNote that, by definition, the empty subset of nodes is an interesting subset, and so the answer is always at least zero.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer T, the number of test cases.\n\n\nEach test case will be formatted as follows:\n\nThe first line will contain a single integer n.\n\n\nThe next n lines will contain n integers each. The j-th integer on the i-th line will denote ci,j.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the maximum possible size of an interesting subset, in a new line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 ci,j \xe2\x89\xa4 n*(n-1)/2 \nif i = j then ci,j = 0\nci,j = cj,i\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n0 1 2\n1 0 3\n2 3 0\n3\n0 1 1\n1 0 3\n1 3 0\n2\n0 1\n1 0\n6\n0 9 2 4 7 8\n9 0 9 9 7 9\n2 9 0 3 7 6\n4 9 3 0 7 1\n7 7 7 7 0 7\n8 9 6 1 7 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n0\n0\n4\n\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the first case, the set of all nodes is an interesting subset.\n\n\nIn the second and third cases, no non-empty subset of nodes is interesting.\n\n\nIn the last case, an interesting subset of nodes is {1,3,4,6}. There is no larger interesting subset.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85lg5293\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85errichto\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RAINBOW\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graphs, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-03-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

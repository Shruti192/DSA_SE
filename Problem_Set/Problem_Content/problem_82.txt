He divides a day into LL units of time (numbered 11 through LL). Chef\'s research shows that his body requires spending only HH continuous units of time per day on sleep \xe2\x80\x94 then, he can stay active during work. However, in case of travel or any other responsibilities, he might not be able to achieve this ideal state.\nNext, Chef noticed that if he sleeps for xx (x<Hx<H) continuous units of time and then performs some other activity, he can still meet his daily sleep quota, but the remaining time he needs to spend on continuously sleeping becomes 2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x)2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x). He can further split this sleeping time in the same way, i.e. if he now sleeps for yy more (y<2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x)y<2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x)) continuous units of time, his required sleeping time becomes 2\xe2\x8b\x85(2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x)\xe2\x88\x92y)2\xe2\x8b\x85(2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x)\xe2\x88\x92y), and so on.\nYou are given a string SS with length LL; for each valid ii, the ii-th character of this string is \'0\' if the ii-th unit of time is free (so Chef can use it to sleep) or \'1\' if it is occupied.\nCan Chef ever get enough sleep to feel fresh during his work, given that he can choose when to sleep in his free time?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers LL and HH.\nThe second line contains a single string SS with length LL.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing the string "YES" if Chef can have the required amount of sleep or "NO" if he cannot (without quotes).\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSS contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3 1\n111\n3 1\n101\n7 5\n0000100\n6 5\n000010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef needs only 11 unit of sleep, but since he is busy all the time, he cannot sleep at all.\nExample case 2: Chef needs only 11 unit of sleep and he has exactly one unit of time when he is free, so he can sleep during that unit of time.\nExample case 3: Chef needs 55 continuous units of sleep. First, he spends the first 44 free units of time, and then he needs 2\xe2\x8b\x85(5\xe2\x88\x924)=22\xe2\x8b\x85(5\xe2\x88\x924)=2 continuous units of sleep, which he has available as the last 22 free units of time.\nExample case 4: Chef needs 55 units of sleep. If he spends the first 44 units of time, he still needs 2\xe2\x8b\x85(5\xe2\x88\x924)=22\xe2\x8b\x85(5\xe2\x88\x924)=2 continuous units of sleep, but only a single unit of time is left now, so he is unable to get enough sleep.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SLPCYCLE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1978\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

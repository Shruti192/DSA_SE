b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is tired of solving boring math problems by hand. One of these problems is summing up the products of elements from each k-subset of the set [n]. Here, a k-subset is a subset containing exactly k elements and [n] refers to the set which contains all integers between 1 and n (inclusive). More formally:\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s denote this number by f(n, k). Note that f(n, 0) = 1.\nSince calculating f(n, k) is too boring, Chef wants to know how the divisibility of f(n, k) by a given prime p depends on k. Specifically, for a fixed n, you should compute the number of ways to select k (0 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 n) so that f(n, k) isn't divisible by p. After a while of thinking, Chef realized there might be too many ways to do that. Therefore, you should compute this number modulo 109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n and p.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one number \xe2\x80\x94 the number of ways to select k, modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 4\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n < 10501\nn does not contain leading zeroes\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 p \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\np is prime\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): n \xe2\x89\xa4 5,000\nSubtask #2 (40 points): n \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The values of f(4, k) are as follows:\n\nf(4, 0) = 1\nf(4, 1) = 1+2+3+4 = 10\nf(4, 2) = 1\xc2\xb72+2\xc2\xb73+3\xc2\xb74+4\xc2\xb71+1\xc2\xb73+2\xc2\xb74 = 35\nf(4, 3) = 1\xc2\xb72\xc2\xb73+2\xc2\xb73\xc2\xb74+1\xc2\xb73\xc2\xb74+1\xc2\xb72\xc2\xb74 = 50\nf(4, 4) = 1\xc2\xb72\xc2\xb73\xc2\xb74 = 24\n\nOnly k = 0 and k = 2 give numbers indivisible by p = 2, so the answer is 2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85yzl427\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85r_64\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LUCASTH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Lucas Theorem, FFT, Divide and Conquer\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic, Transformations, Algorithms, Recursion\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2757\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-11-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\n\xc2\xa0\nBefore the conversion from ISM to IIT, the administration had started preparing for it by constructing new buildings in the campus, so that the campus must be at par with the infrastructures available in other IITs. Now, let us assume that all the free locations in the campus can be represented as a Matrix of N * M. Each element of the matrix is an integer which denotes the level of satisfaction the admin will get by constructing a building at that point. For a building whose corner points can be denoted by the points (x, y), (x, w), (z, y) and (z, w) gives a satisfaction equals to sum of all values that it encloses within these four points.\nFor example, consider the matrix: \n1 2 3 4\n2 3 4 5\n3 4 5 6\nThe satisfaction value for the building denoted by the end points (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4) is 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 36 \nBut the admin is quite sceptical when constructing buildings and prefers to construct only those building which will provide a satisfaction S which follows the following rule. \nB = S mod A , where A and B are some integers\nNow the Admin wants to know, how many such buildings can be made which satisfies the above criterion ?\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line contains four space separated integers N , M, A and  B . Then N lines follow. Each of the next N lines contains M space separated integers. Thus input is a matrix of order  N x M \nOutput\nOutput a single line denoting the number of buildings that will satisfy the criterion mentioned in the problem statement.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 350\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 350\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 A \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 B < A\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Value of any matrix element \xe2\x89\xa4 2500000000\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2 2 3 2\n2 5    \n6 1\n\nOutput:\n4\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nThe buildings that will satisfy the constraint are {(1,1)} = 2 mod 3 = 2{(1,2)} = 5 mod 3 = 2 {(1, 1), (2, 1)} = 2 + 6 = 8 mod 3 = 2 and  {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)} = 2 + 5 + 6 + 1 = 14 mod 3 = 2 \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85surajjumpy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GOOGOL02\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, dynamic-programming, hashing, surajjumpy, two-pointers\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-03-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 - 2.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, PYPY, TEXT\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

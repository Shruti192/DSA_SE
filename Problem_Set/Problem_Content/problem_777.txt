b'\nMohammed has a wire, its length is nn. He wants to cut the wire in a way that fulfils the following two conditions:\n\nAfter the cutting each wire piece should have length aa, bb or cc.\nAfter the cutting the number of wire pieces should be maximum.\n\nHelp Mohammed and find the number of wire pieces after the required cutting.\nInput\n\nThe first and the only line contains four space-separated integers nn, aa, bb and cc (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x89b,\xe2\x80\x89c\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x894000)(1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x89b,\xe2\x80\x89c\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x894000) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the original wire and the acceptable lengths of the wire pieces after the cutting, correspondingly. The numbers aa, bb and cc can coincide.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single number \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible number of wire pieces. It is guaranteed that at least one correct wire cutting exists.\nSample Inputs\n5 5 3 2\n\n7 5 5 2\n\nSample Outputs\n 2\n\n 2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example Mohammed can cut the wire in such way: the first piece has length 2, the second piece has length 3.\nIn the second example Mohammed can cut the wire in such way: the first piece has length 5, the second piece has length 2.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsqu_test\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HW2D\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 chw22020, dynamic-programming, squ_test\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-04-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\nAlice has learnt factorization recently. Bob doesn't think she has learnt it properly and hence he has decided to quiz her. Bob gives Alice a very large number and asks her to find out the number of factors of that number. To make it a little easier for her, he represents the number as a product of N numbers. Alice is frightened of big numbers and hence is asking you for help. Your task is simple. Given N numbers, you need to tell the number of distinct factors of the product of these N numbers.\nInput:\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test starts with a line containing a single integer N. The next line consists of N space separated integers (Ai).Output:\nFor each test case, output on a separate line the total number of factors of the product of given numbers.Constraints:\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000\n\n\nScoring:\nYou will be awarded 40 points for correctly solving for Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 100.\nYou will be awarded another 30 points for correctly solving for Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 10000.\nThe remaining 30 points will be awarded for correctly solving for Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n3 5 7\n3\n2 4 6\n2\n5 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n10\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nvamsi_adm\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rubanenko\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NUMFACT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sieve of Eratosthenes, Prime Divisors\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Divisors\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1710\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-06-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

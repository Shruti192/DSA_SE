b'\n Problem Statement\nYou are given an array of nn integers and there are 22 people: P1P1 and P2P2. \n\nEach person picks up any one element and adds its value to their score. Initially the score of both P1P1 and P2P2 is 00 . However the person who plays second can take two elements in his/her first try and then both will take one element in alternate turns. \n\nExample: if P1P1 goes first, then the pickup sequence can look like: \n\nP1\xe2\x86\x92P2\xe2\x86\x92P2\xe2\x86\x92P1\xe2\x86\x92P2\xe2\x86\x92P1\xe2\x86\x92P2....P1\xe2\x86\x92P2\xe2\x86\x92P2\xe2\x86\x92P1\xe2\x86\x92P2\xe2\x86\x92P1\xe2\x86\x92P2....\n\n\nEach person wants to maximize his/her score and both of them play optimally.\n\nP1P1 wants to win and is asking for your help. Tell whether P1P1 should play "first" or "second". If both of them will get the same score independent of who plays first, then output \xe2\x80\x9cdraw\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nNote: Each element can be taken only once (i.e. once it is taken by some person, it cannot be taken again). \n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer tt. The number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case contains an integer nn. The number of elements in the array.\nSecond line of each test case contains nn space separated integers aa11, aa22, aa33 ... aann.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print one line containing one of the following word without quotes:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cfirst\xe2\x80\x9d if P1P1 should play first.\n\xe2\x80\x9csecond\xe2\x80\x9d if P1P1 should play second.\n\xe2\x80\x9cdraw\xe2\x80\x9d if both of them will get the same score independent of who plays first.\nNote: the output is case sensitive, so \xe2\x80\x9cFIRST\xe2\x80\x9d will be considered as wrong output.\n\nConstraints: \n\n 1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4151\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa415 \n 1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104 \n 1\xe2\x89\xa41\xe2\x89\xa4 aaii \xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x89\xa4109, where 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\nSample Input\n2\n3\n1 1 1\n4\n1 1 1 1\nSample Output\nsecond\ndraw\nExplanation\nThere are two test cases:\n\nIn the first test case, the person who plays first will get the total sum = 1 since the person who plays second will take both the remaining 1s. Hence P1P1 should play second.\n\nIn the second test case, both will get the sum = 2 so it doesn\'t matter who plays first. It will always result in draw.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dj_r_1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TOWIN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-07-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

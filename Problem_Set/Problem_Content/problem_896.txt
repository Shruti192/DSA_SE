b'\nThere is going to be an election in Chefland between Alice and Bob. In an election, all voters stand in a queue and vote one by one. Voter at position ii in the queue votes at the beginning of ii-th minute. After the results were declared, Alice got AA votes and Bob got BB votes. Thus, the voting happens for A+BA+B minutes. Chef, being an statistician, decided to play with election results. He wants to calculate the duration for which Alice was ahead of Bob at the time of voting, but he does not remember the initial arrangement of voters in queue. Help him to calculate the expected value of the duration, in minutes, if the voters are arranged randomly, that is, every arrangement is equally likely. If the answer is P/QP/Q where P,QP,Q are co-prime integers and Q\xe2\x89\xa00Q\xe2\x89\xa00, output RR such that 0\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4109+60\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4109+6 and R\xc3\x97Q\xe2\x89\xa1Pmod(109+7)R\xc3\x97Q\xe2\x89\xa1Pmod(109+7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers A,BA,B. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output answer in a single line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A+B1\xe2\x89\xa4A+B\nSum of A\xc3\x97BA\xc3\x97B over all test cases does not exceed 107107\n\nSubtasks\n\n7 points : 0\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa480\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa48\n10 points : 0\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4140\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa414\n28 points : Sum of A\xc3\x97BA\xc3\x97B over all test cases does not exceed 105105\n55 points : Original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n2\n2 1\n1 2\n\nSample Output:\n2\n333333336\n\nExplanantion:\nCase 1: Say voter A1,A2A1,A2 vote for Alice and voter B1B1 votes for Bob. There are 6 possible permutations:\n\n(A1,A2,B1)(A1,A2,B1) Alice leads during minute 1,2,31,2,3\n(A1,B1,A2)(A1,B1,A2) Alice leads during minute 1,31,3\n(A2,A1,B1)(A2,A1,B1) Alice leads during minute 1,2,31,2,3\n(A2,B1,A1)(A2,B1,A1) Alice leads during minute 1,31,3\n(B1,A1,A2)(B1,A1,A2) Alice leads during minute 33\n(B1,A2,A1)(B1,A2,A1) Alice leads during minute 33\n\nThus, expected value is (3+2+3+2+1+1)/6=2(3+2+3+2+1+1)/6=2 or P=2,Q=1P=2,Q=1.\nCase 2: Say voter A1A1 votes for Alice and voter B1,B2B1,B2 vote for Bob. There are 6 possible permutations:\n\n(B1,B2,A1)(B1,B2,A1) Alice never leads\n(B1,A1,B2)(B1,A1,B2) Alice never leads\n(B2,B1,A1)(B2,B1,A1) Alice never leads\n(B2,A1,B1)(B2,A1,B1) Alice never leads\n(A1,B1,B2)(A1,B1,B2) Alice leads during minute 11\n(A1,B2,B1)(A1,B2,B1) Alice leads during minute 11\n\nThus, expected value is (0+0+0+0+1+1)/6=1/3(0+0+0+0+1+1)/6=1/3 or P=1,Q=3P=1,Q=3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85praran26\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ELECTION\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, locmay18, praran26\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-05-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

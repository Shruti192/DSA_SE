b"\n\xc2\xa0\nProblem description.\nRishabh doesn't know programming. As a programmer you thought you could help him. The problem is that you have T intervals. From each interval you will pick one integer value(integer picked could be the boundary also). Now you are required to sum those values. For each integer Ni between N and N+X(both included), print the total number of ways in which these values can be picked so that the sum of values is equal to Ni. As this number of ways may be large, print your answer modulo 1000000007. In case no such way exist, print NO corresponding to the sum. Also note {1,2} is different from {2,1}.\nInput\n\nInput begins with the first line containing T denoting the number of intervals.\nThen T lines contains s,e.\nThe last line contains N and X.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput X+1 lines each line containing the number of ways of forming the required sum.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4  1000000 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4  100 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X \xe2\x89\xa4  1000 \nEach of the interval is [s,e] where s>=0 and e<=500, s<=e\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n0 2\n2 5\n1 2\nOutput:\nNO\n1\n2\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nThere are two intervals . The number 1 cannot be formed as we have to take one integer each from 2 intervals, whereas 2 has 1 way and 3 has 2 ways.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85f2012086\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ACMICL5\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, f2012086, hard, icl2015\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-02-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

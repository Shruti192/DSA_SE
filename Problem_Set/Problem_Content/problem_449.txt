Since we love Reza Shiri and his songs, we never download them for free. Reza Shiri\xe2\x80\x99s songs must be purchased from authorised stores. However, what if there is not enough money to buy all the songs?\nThere are NN songs (numbered 11 through NN) and MM albums (numbered 11 through MM) available. For each valid ii, the ii-th song has greatness vivi, price pipi and belongs to the album aiai. For each valid ii, the ii-th album has price bibi. If we buy an album, then all songs from this album count as bought. It is also possible to buy any songs individually.\nYour task is simple \xe2\x80\x95 given the budget PP (the amount of money we have), calculate the maximum total greatness of songs we can buy. The total greatness is defined as the sum of greatness values of all distinct songs that are bought (either individually or as part of albums).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and PP.\nNN lines follow. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers aiai, pipi and vivi.\nThe last line contains MM space-separated integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bMb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bM.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum total greatness of songs we can afford to buy.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,P\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,P\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi,pi\xe2\x89\xa4P1\xe2\x89\xa4bi,pi\xe2\x89\xa4P for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4M for each valid ii\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 2 24\n1 7 2\n1 5 2\n1 4 1\n2 9 1\n2 13 2\n10 15\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85erfaniaa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SONGSHOP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2316\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-03-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

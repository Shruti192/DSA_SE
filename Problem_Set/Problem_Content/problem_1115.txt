b'\nGiven a binary string SS consisting of only 1\xe2\x80\x99s and 0\xe2\x80\x99s where 1 represents a Square and 0 represents a Circle. The diameter of the circle and the side of the square must be any integer (obviously > 0) . You will have to perfectly inscribe (as shown in the example below) the respective geometric figure at SSi+1i+1 inside of SSii where ii \xcf\xb5\xcf\xb5 [0,N\xe2\x88\x922][0,N\xe2\x88\x922], if it is possible. Note that, it will not be possible to inscribe if the dimension of the geometric figure you are perfectly inscribing is not an integer and you will discard the rest of the string. Find the maximum number of circles we can inscribe in a square according to the given string.  \nFor a given binary string there can be only one geometric figure and this figure is concentric.  \nFor example : the string 1100 can be represented as the figure below, the first two squares have the same side length and the next two circles have the same diameter.  \n \nAnother example : the string 0001 can be represented as the one given below\nAgain here, we have 3 circles of the same diameter and one square inscribed in them.  \n \nInput:\nThe first line contains NN, the number of strings\nThen each of the next NN lines contains a binary string SS.  \nOutput:\nThe NN lines of output should have NN integers in separate lines, the maximum number of circles we can inscribe in a square according to the given string SS .  \nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 NN \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 103\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 length of string SS \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 104\n\nSample Input:\n3\n1110\n0010\n1001000  \nSample Output:\n1\n0\n2  \nExplanation:\nIn  the first case, we can inscribe the string 1110 as :  three squares of side length 4 units (on top of each other) and then  we can inscribe one circle of diameter 4 units.\nThe answer is 1 since, there is 1 circle inscribed in a square.\nIn the second case 0010, Let the first two circles be of some diameter 10, we can see that we cannot inscribe another square of any integer dimension inside them.\nSo, the answer is 0.\nIn the third case 1001000, we can take the first square of size 10, then inscribe two circles of diameter 5, then we cannot inscribe another square in this since, it will not be of any possible integer dimension and we discard the rest of the string.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85imreally_john\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BININSC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, chil2020, geometry, imreally_john, math\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

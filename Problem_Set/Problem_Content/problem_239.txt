b"\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, and Russian as well.\nAlice and Bob have a permutation of size NN, so they started playing a game on it. They both have their own copies of an initial permutation on which they perform moves in turns. Note that although Bob's and Alice's permutations are initially similar in values, they are the not the same permutation; any move Alice makes only changes her permutation and not Bob's, and vice versa.\nAlice goes first. In one move, they can do the following on their respective permutations:\n\nChoose two indices ii and jj and swap PiPi and PjPj.\n\nThe player who sorts their permutation first, wins the game.\nBoth players play optimally. But unfortunately, on playing a lot of games, Alice won all of those. Bob realized that something is unfair and told Alice to play with some handicap.\nSo they mutually agreed that, Alice is given an extra potential array VV of size NN. Now Alice can do the following move only:\n\nChoose two indices ii and jj such that, 0<Vi0<Vi AND 0<Vj0<Vj.\nIf no such indices exist, skip her turn.\nElse swap PiPi and PjPj and then decrement ViVi and VjVj by 11.\n\nBob plays as usual without any potential array. Alice goes first.\nReport who wins if both play optimally, and find the strategy for the winner. You also need to determine the shortest sequence of moves to victory.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN - the size of the permutation.\nThe next line contains NN space separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN.\nThe next line contains NN space separated integers V1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VNV1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case:\n\nOutput on the first line the winner of the match, i.e. Alice or Bob. You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings Alice, ALICE, alIcE and aLiCe will all be treated as identical).\nOutput on the next line an integer MM - the minimum number of moves taken by the winner.\nThen output MM lines, where the ii-th line contains two integers denoting the ii-th move by the winner.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa4109\nP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN form a permutation of values from 11 to NN\n\xe2\x88\x91N\xe2\x88\x91N over all test cases is at most 105105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n10\n1 8 10 4 2 5 7 9 3 6\n2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2\n10\n6 2 9 1 7 8 10 5 3 4\n2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nBob\n6\n2 8\n2 9\n2 3\n2 10\n2 6\n2 5\nALiCE\n7\n3 9\n1 4\n4 10\n10 7\n7 5\n5 8\n8 6\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85anshugarg12\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SRTGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Greedy, Cycles, Constructive, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2862\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\xc2\xa0\nSereja has an array A that contains n integers, namely A1, A2, ..., An. A single action consists of performing one of two following operations:\n\nTo swap two consecutive elements;\nTo make a random and uniform shuffle of all the elements of the array A.\n\nNow Sereja's goal is to make the expected value of the function f(A) as minimal as possible, by doing no more than k actions.\nThe function f(A) is the minimal number of consecutive elements' swaps you need in order to sort the array A in the increasing order.\nWhat is the expected value of f(A) in case Sereja uses no more than k actions in the optimal way?\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of testcases. Then, T testcase descriptions follow.\nThe first line of each desription contains the integers n and k from the statement, respectively. The following line contains n space separated integers - A1, A2, ..., An. All the values of Ai will form a permutation of the first N natural numbers.\nOutput\nFor each test case output the minimal possible expected value of f(A). Your answer will be considered correct in case it differs by no more than 10-6 from the official one.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2 1\n2 1\n3 1\n3 2 1\n\nOutput:\n0.0000\n1.5000\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsereja_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SEABUB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Expected Value, DP Approach\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2554\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-03-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThis is an interactive problem.\nShef chose some prime number PP between 22 and 109109 inclusive. You want to guess it.\nBefore that, you may ask Shef at most MM questions, since he is quite busy. In each question, you tell Shef an integer xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109) and Shef tells you x2x2 modulo PP. At the end, you guess Shef\'s prime PP and he tells you if your guess was correct.\nHowever, Shef will sometimes cheat: he can change his prime any number of times during the game (even after you tell him your guess), but only in such a way that all his answers to your previous questions remain correct.\nShow Shef that you can always guess the correct prime, even if he tries to cheat!\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you should read a line containing a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for TT test cases follows.\nFor each test case, you should start by asking questions (possibly none).\nTo ask a question, print a line containing two space-separated integers 11 and xx.\nThen, you must read a line containing a single integer.\nIf this integer is \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921, your query was invalid or you asked too many queries, and you should immediately terminate your program to receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you may receive any verdict.\nOtherwise, this integer denotes Shef\'s answer to your query.\nWhen you think you know Shef\'s prime PP, print a line containing two space-separated integers 22 and PP.\nThen, you must read a line containing a single string "Yes" or "No". If this string is "Yes", you should continue solving the remaining test cases. Otherwise, your answer was incorrect and you should immediately terminate your program to receive the Wrong Answer verdict.\n\nDon\'t forget to flush the output after printing each line!\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nM=10M=10\nShef chooses PP in advance and does not cheat\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points):\n\nM=5M=5\nShef chooses PP in advance and does not cheat\n\nSubtask #3 (70 points): M=2M=2\nExample\nYou           Grader\n              2\n1 3\n              0\n2 3\n              Yes\n1 10\n              2\n1 3\n              2\n2 7\n              Yes\n\nExplanation\nExample case 2: Shef\'s first answer is 22 because 102=100\xe2\x89\xa12102=100\xe2\x89\xa12 modulo 77.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85bohdan\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GUESSPRM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Integer Factorisation, Prime Divisors, Primes\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Divisors\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2055\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-05-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

There are NN stations on the xx-axis, with coordinates x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xNx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xN, and MM stations on the yy-axis, with coordinates y1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yMy1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yM. Chef has completed his task and built a rail track (line segment) between each pair of stations.\nNow, Chef is wondering how many right triangles have the following property: the vertices are stations and the sides are railway tracks between them. Since Chef is busy with his other projects, help him answer this question.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xNx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xN.\nThe third line contains MM space-separated integers y1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yMy1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yM.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of right triangles.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|xi|\xe2\x89\xa4105|xi|\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid ii\n|yi|\xe2\x89\xa4105|yi|\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid ii\nthe positions of the stations are pairwise distinct\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\nN,M\xe2\x89\xa4102N,M\xe2\x89\xa4102\n\nSubtask #2 (25 points):\n\nN,M\xe2\x89\xa4103N,M\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2\n-4 2\n2 -8\n8 4\n1 2 3 6 -1 -2 -3 -6\n6 -6 1 -1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are no triplets where two stations lie on the xx-axis and one triplet where two stations lie on the yy-axis, which is ((0,2),(0,\xe2\x88\x928),(\xe2\x88\x924,0))((0,2),(0,\xe2\x88\x928),(\xe2\x88\x924,0)).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFRAIL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Number Theory, Geometry, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-11-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

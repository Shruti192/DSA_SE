You have to find the sum of three numbers such that lcm of first two numbers and last two numbers are given. These three numbers are pairwise distinct and also co prime to one other.   \nInput:\nt: no of test cases\nm,n: lcm of first two numbers and last two numbers respectively  \nOutput:\nSum of three numbers  \nConstraints:\n1<=t<=1000\n1<=m,n<=10000  \nSample Input:\n2\n6 15\n35 77  \nSample Output:\n10\n23  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85avishake_maji\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 avishake_maji, math, medium, number-theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

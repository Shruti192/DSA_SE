He then chose two candles, say  A  and  B  and lit them up. Now, he left the kitchen and decided to come back in some time with friends to celebrate the birthday.\nMeanwhile Chef's little brother came to the kitchen and saw the cake. He wants to light up one of the not lit candles C such that angle  ACB  is an obtuse angle. He believes that such a pattern of lit candles will be auspicious. Can you find out how many candles C he can light up?\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing three space-separated integers k, A, B. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer: the answer for the test case.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4  105 \n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4  109 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 A, B \xe2\x89\xa4 k \n A \xe2\x89\xa0 B \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n6 1 3\n6 1 4\n10 1 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Only candle with number 2 is suitable.\nExample case 2. No matter how we choose C the angle would have 90 degrees.\nExample case 3.

b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nChef has an integer array X, and a binary array S, both of size N. He wants to know how many vectors (denote by V) of N elements exist, for which the following conditions hold for all valid indices i (that is, for all 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N).\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Vi < 1018\nIf Si = 1, Vi is \xe2\x89\xa5 Xi, and if Si = 0, Vi \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi\nSum of the elements of V, when viewed as a string, contains "47" as a substring.\n\n\nPlease help Chef find this count. Since it may be a very large number, you should output the count modulo 109+7.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains one integer N. The next N lines contain two integers each, with the ith containing Si and Xi. If Si = 0, then Vi \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi, otherwise Vi \xe2\x89\xa5 Xi.\n\nOutput\nOutput a single line containing a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the answer to Chef\'s problem modulo 109+7.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 8\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi < 1018\nSi is either 0 or 1. \n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n0 22\n0 30\n\nOutput:\n6\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nThere are 6 such vectors: (17, 30), (18, 29), (19, 28), (20, 27), (21, 26), (22, 25).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFVEC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Bitmask\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3018\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-12-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a two-dimensional matrix A of dimensions N \xc3\x97 M, (N rows and M columns). \nHe calls the matrix A beautiful if there exist an a\xc3\x97b submatrix, such that all of its elements are equal. In one minute Chef can increase one element of the matrix A by 1. Now he asks you to find out minimum time he will need to make the matrix A beautiful?\n\nPlease note that sub-matrix of a matrix is a continuous rectangular block of the matrix. It can be denoted by two pair of indices (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) where x1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x2, y1 \xe2\x89\xa4 y2. The content of the submatrix will be all the cells (i, j) such that x1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 x2 and y1 \xe2\x89\xa4 j \xe2\x89\xa4 y2.\n\nInput\n\nThere is a single test case.\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers N, M denoting the number of rows and columns in the matrix A, respectively\nEach of the next N lines, contains M space-separated integers denoting the i-th row of the array\nNext line contains one integer Q - amount of questions\nEach of next Q lines contains two space-separated integers a and b denoting sizes of submatrix sought.\nAll questions are independent and do not influence each other. It means when you answer question, you don't need to change the array\n\nOutput\nFor each question, output a single line containing the minimum time that Chef needs to make an matrix A beautiful (for parameters a and b from question)\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M, Ai, j \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 b \xe2\x89\xa4 M\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (13 pts)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nTL = 1s\n\n\nSubtask #2 (35 pts)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 200\nTL = 2s\n\n\nSubtask #3 (52 pts)\n\nOriginal constraints\nTL = 4s\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 4\n1 8 3 4\n5 2 3 1\n3 6 2 2\n4\n1 1\n2 2\n2 3\n3 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n4\n15\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nQuestion #1:\nChef can choose any 1 \xc3\x97 1 submatrix and it will take his 0 minutes to make it beautiful.\n\nQuestion #2: \nThe best variant is submatrix \n3 1\n2 2\n\n\nQuestion #3:\nThe next submatrix Chef can make equal in 15 minutes\n5 2 3\n3 6 2\n\n\nQuestion #4:\n3 4\n3 1\n2 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85antoniuk1\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHSQARR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Deque, Sparse Table, Dynamic Programming, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Queues, Advanced Data Structures, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2088\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-07-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

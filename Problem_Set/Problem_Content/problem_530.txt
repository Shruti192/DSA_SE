b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChef invented a new game named Quick Battle Royale. NN people play the game. One or more rounds are played until all players except one are eliminated. In each round:\n\nLet there be xx non-eliminated players at the start of the round. Let's number them 11 through xx.\nFirst, each of these players chooses an integer between 11 and xx inclusive. For each valid ii, let's denote the integer chosen by the ii-th player by pipi. In addition, each player is not allowed to choose pi=ipi=i. Under these conditions, all players choose uniformly randomly and independently.\nThen, the elimination process starts. For each ii from 11 to xx, in this order:\nif the player ii is currently still in the game, the player pipi is eliminated from the game immediately\nif the player ii was already eliminated from the game in this round, nothing happens\n\nNote that it is impossible for all players to be eliminated and in each round, at least one player is eliminated.\nFor example, a game for N=4N=4 could look like this:\n\nRound 1: The players choose p1=3p1=3, p2=4p2=4, p3=2p3=2, p4=2p4=2. For i=1i=1, since player 11 is still in the game, player pi=3pi=3 is eliminated. For i=2i=2, since player 22 is also in the game, player pi=4pi=4 is eliminated. Since the players 33 and 44 are eliminated, nothing more happens.\nRound 2: Two players remain. The only choice they have is p1=2p1=2 and p2=1p2=1. For i=1i=1, since player 11 is still in the game, player pi=2pi=2 gets eliminated. For i=2i=2, player 22 is eliminated, so nothing happens.\n\nNow there is one player left, so the game ends. It lasted 22 rounds.\nYou have to find the expected value of the number of rounds the game will last. It can be shown that the expected number of rounds can be written as a fraction pqpq, where pp and qq are positive integers and qq is coprime with 109+7109+7. You have to compute p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+7109+7, where q\xe2\x88\x921q\xe2\x88\x921 is the multiplicative inverse of qq modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN denoting the number of players at the start of the game.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nExample Input\n5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nExample Output\n0\n1\n500000005\n944444453\n616319451\n\nExplanation\nExample case 3: The answer is 3232 modulo (109+7)(109+7). The following cases can happen in the first round (with equal probabilities):\n    - p=[2,1,1]p=[2,1,1], game lasts 11 round\n    - p=[2,1,2]p=[2,1,2], game lasts 22 rounds\n    - p=[2,3,1]p=[2,3,1], game lasts 11 round \n    - p=[2,3,2]p=[2,3,2], game lasts 22 rounds\n    - p=[3,1,1]p=[3,1,1], game lasts 11 round\n    - p=[3,1,2]p=[3,1,2], game lasts 11 round\n    - p=[3,3,1]p=[3,3,1], game lasts 22 rounds\n    - p=[3,3,2]p=[3,3,2], game lasts 22 rounds\nExample case 4: The answer is 35183518 modulo (109+7)(109+7).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85nadeemsk4347\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BTTLRYL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Expected Value, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2795\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-06-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

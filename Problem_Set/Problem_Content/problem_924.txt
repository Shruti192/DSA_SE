b'\nChef is currently working for a secret research group called NEXTGEN.\nWhile the rest of the world is still in search of a way to utilize Helium-3 as a fuel, NEXTGEN scientists have been able to achieve 2 major milestones:\n\nFinding a way to make a nuclear reactor that will be able to utilize Helium-3 as a fuel\nObtaining every bit of Helium-3 from the moon\'s surface\n\nMoving forward, the project requires some government funding for completion, which comes under one condition:\nto prove its worth, the project should power Chefland by generating at least AA units of power each year for the next BB years.\nHelp Chef determine whether the group will get funded assuming that the moon has XX grams of Helium-3 and 11 gram of Helium-3 can provide YY units of power.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer TT, the number of testcases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line of input, containing four space-separated integers A,B,X,YA,B,X,Y respectively.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case print on a single line the answer \xe2\x80\x94 Yes if NEXTGEN satisfies the government\'s minimum requirements for funding and No otherwise.\nYou may print each character of the answer string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,X,Y,\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,X,Y,\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1 2 3 4\n4 3 2 1\n2 18 9 4\n1 100 2 49\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: Chefland requires A=1A=1 units of power for the next B=2B=2 years. In total, the moon must be capable of providing A\xe2\x8b\x85B=2A\xe2\x8b\x85B=2 units of power. There are in total X=3X=3 grams of Helium-3 on the moon which is capable of providing X\xe2\x8b\x85Y=12X\xe2\x8b\x85Y=12 units of power. 12>212>2, so the project satisfies the minimum requirements for funding. Thus, the answer is Yes.\nTest case 22: The total amount of power needed by Chefland is A\xe2\x8b\x85B=12A\xe2\x8b\x85B=12, whereas the total that can be provided by the Helium-3 present on the moon is X\xe2\x8b\x85Y=2X\xe2\x8b\x85Y=2, which is insufficient to receive funding, so the answer is No.\nTest case 33: The total amount of power needed by Chefland is A\xe2\x8b\x85B=2\xe2\x8b\x8518=36A\xe2\x8b\x85B=2\xe2\x8b\x8518=36, and the total that can be provided by the Helium-3 present on the moon is X\xe2\x8b\x85Y=9\xe2\x8b\x854=36X\xe2\x8b\x85Y=9\xe2\x8b\x854=36, which is sufficient to receive funding, so the answer is Yes.\nTest case 44: The total amount of power needed by Chefland is A\xe2\x8b\x85B=1\xe2\x8b\x85100=100A\xe2\x8b\x85B=1\xe2\x8b\x85100=100, and the total that can be provided by the Helium-3 present on the moon is X\xe2\x8b\x85Y=2\xe2\x8b\x8549=98X\xe2\x8b\x85Y=2\xe2\x8b\x8549=98, which is insufficient to receive funding, so the answer is No.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsrikkanth_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HELIUM3\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, feb222, math, srikkanth_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n562\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

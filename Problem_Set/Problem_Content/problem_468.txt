Each city has its own traditional dish for which it is famous; let's denote the tastiness of the dish in city ii by AiAi.\nChef is currently learning how to prepare tastier dishes. At any point, he can only remember how to cook one dish. Initially, the tastiness of the dish he can cook is WW. Chef is going to travel from city 11 to city vv. In each city he visits (including 11 and vv), if the tastiness of the traditional dish of this city is strictly greater than the tastiness of the dish he can currently cook, then he forgets the dish he can currently cook and learns the traditional dish of this city.\nNow, Chef is wondering how many times he is going to learn a new dish during his trip. You should answer QQ independent queries. In each query, you are given the initial tastiness WW and Chef's final destination vv; compute the number of times Chef learns a new dish. Note that the input is given in a special format, so you have to answer the queries online.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer NN. \nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line contains N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers P2,P3,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP2,P3,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN, meaning there's an edge between ii and PiPi.\nThe fourth line contains one integer QQ. \nEach of the following QQ lines contains two space-separated integers AA and BB describing a query in the following format:\nLet's denote the answer to the previous query by PrPr (Pr=0Pr=0 if this is the first query).\nFor this query, v=A\xe2\x8a\x95Prv=A\xe2\x8a\x95Pr and W=B\xe2\x8a\x95PrW=B\xe2\x8a\x95Pr.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of times Chef learns a new dish.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41062\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4108 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa4108\n1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of NN for all test cases does not exceed 106106\nthe sum of QQ for all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n2 3 1 4 5\n1 2 2 3\n2\n2 1\n1 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dolabmoon\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Pre processing, Dynamic Programming, DFS, Binary lifting\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Lowest Common Ancestor\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2715\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-09-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

In other words, the cities and roads form a tree. For each valid ii, the ii-th city's height above sea level is AiAi.\nA path between two cities is said to be beautiful if the heights of the cities in the path first increase and then decrease. In other words, when we denote the sequence of cities the path passes through by x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xLx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xL, it is beautiful if Ax1<Ax2<\xe2\x80\xa6<Axp>\xe2\x80\xa6>AxL\xe2\x88\x921>AxLAx1<Ax2<\xe2\x80\xa6<Axp>\xe2\x80\xa6>AxL\xe2\x88\x921>AxL holds for some integer pp (1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4L1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4L).\nChefina is planning a trip along a path in the tree. You should answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given two cities xx and yy and you should tell Chefina if the simple path between these cities is beautiful.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and QQ.\nEach of the following N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that cities uu and vv are connected by a road.\nThe next line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nEach of the following QQ lines contains two space-separated integers xx and yy describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing a string with length QQ. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of this string should be '1' if the path in the ii-th query is beautiful or '0' otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\nthe sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 4\n1 5\n1 2\n4 2\n2 3\n4 6 2 1 5\n1 5\n3 4\n3 2\n5 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1110\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The sequence of heights of cities on the path from city 11 to city 55 is [4,5][4,5], and 4<54<5 holds, so it is a beautiful path.\nExample case 2: The sequence of heights of cities on the path from city 33 to city 44 is [2,6,1][2,6,1], and 2<6>12<6>1, so it is a beautiful path.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFTRIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP on Trees, Lowest Common Ancestor, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2328\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

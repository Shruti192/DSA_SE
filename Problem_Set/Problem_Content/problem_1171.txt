b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef likes problems on geometry a lot. Please help him to solve one such problem.\nFind all possible triangles with integer sides which has the radius of inscribed circle (also known as incircle) equal to R.\nTwo triangles are said to be different if they have at least one different side lengths. Formally, let there be two triangles T1, T2. Let a, b, c denote the sides of triangle T1, such that a \xe2\x89\xa4 b \xe2\x89\xa4 c. Similarly, Let d, e, f denote the sides of triangle T2, such that d \xe2\x89\xa4 e \xe2\x89\xa4 f. Then T1 will said to be different from T2 if either a \xe2\x89\xa0 d, or b \xe2\x89\xa0 e or c \xe2\x89\xa0 f.\nInput\nThere is a single test case per test file.\nThe only line of input contains an integer R.\nOutput\nOutput in first line single number - number of triangles satisfying statement.\nOrder the sides of triangles in non-decreasing order. Output all triangles in non-decreasing order, i.e. order first by smallest sides, otherwise by second smallest sides, if first and second sides equal, then by third.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 100 \n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1: (20 points)  1 \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 3\nSubtask #2: (30 points)  1 \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 20\nSubtask #3: (50 points)  Original constraints\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n\nOutput:\n5\n5 12 13\n6 8 10\n6 25 29\n7 15 20\n9 10 17\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Geometry, Triangles, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Computational Geometry, Polygons, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2952\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

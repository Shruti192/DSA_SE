b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has two piles of stones with him, one has n1 stones and the other has n2 stones. Fired up by boredom, he invented a game with the two piles.\n\nBefore the start of the game Chef chooses an integer m.\n\n\nIn the j-th move: \n He chooses a number xj such that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 xj \xe2\x89\xa4 m, and removes xj stones from both the piles (this is only possible when both the piles have \xe2\x89\xa5 xj stones).\n The number chosen must be unique over all the moves in the game. That is, for all k < j, xj \xe2\x89\xa0 xk.\n\n\nThe game stops when Chef is unable to make any more moves.\n\n\nChef wants to make the moves in such a way that the sum of the number of stones remaining in the two piles is minimized. Please help Chef find this.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of 1 line with three integers \xe2\x80\x94 n1, n2 and m \xe2\x80\x94 separated by single spaces.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum sum of the number of stones of two piles.\nConstraints\nSubtask 1 : (5 pts)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 18\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 n1, n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask 2 : (25 pts)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 n1, n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\nSubtask 3 : (70 pts)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 n1, n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 1 1\n1 2 1\n4 5 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. : Remove 1 stone from each of the piles. Now 0 stones are remaining, so chef cannot remove any more stones from the piles. Hence, answer is 0+0 = 0\nExample case 2. : Again, remove 1 stone from both the piles to get (0,1) stones. Now chef cannot remove any more stones from pile 1, so he stops. Hence, answer is 0+1 = 1.\nExample case 3. : First remove 1 stone from both the piles to get (3,4) stones. Now, remove 2 stones from both the piles so that (1,2) stones are remaining. Now chef cannot remove any more stones owing to the condition that he cannot remove the same number of stones twice. So, the answer is 1+2 = 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85tapasjain01\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 AP\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Sequences and Progression\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1441\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-07-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

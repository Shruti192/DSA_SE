b'\nWith this jump, you move further in time and land inside the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. The ways of time are completely bizarre. You hear the same laugh which pushed you in this machine and you turn to find the mad scientist, Prof Paradox. He laughs telling you that you have entered doomsday and that the whole Homosapien species ends that day. Though shocked you are determined to stop this, whatever it might be.\nProf Paradox is a part of the Asteroid Impact Avoidance Committee [AIAC] in NASA and he informs you that NN asteroids, with varying sizes, are approaching Earth and if left unattended, it will end life on Earth as we know it. Fortunately you have KK nuclear plasma blasters that can destroy an asteroid. The cost of each blast is determined by the size of the asteroid. However, after each blast, the cost required increases. \nIf xx is the number of blasts already fired by a blaster BiBi, then the cost of the next blast in the blaster BiBi is (x+1)\xe2\x88\x97S(x+1)\xe2\x88\x97S where SS is the size of the asteroid. You are free to use any number of the available KK blasters. \nCan you avoid this collision course by finding the minimum cost required to save our planet?\nSince the results can be large, output result modulo 1000000007 (109+7109+7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nFirst line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,KN,K.\nSecond line of each testcase contains NN spaced integers denoting the size of the asteroid. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the minimum cost required to destroy all the asteroids modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4SizeofeachAsteroid\xe2\x89\xa410000001\xe2\x89\xa4SizeofeachAsteroid\xe2\x89\xa41000000\n\nSubtasks\n\n25 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4100\n75 points : original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n2\n5 3\n4 2 5 3 9   \n3 3\n2 5 6\n\nSample Output :\n28\n13\n\nEXPLANATION 1:\nWe have 33 plasma blasters,                                                                     \n1st1st and 2nd2nd asteroid can be shot by blaster 11:\nCost=(4\xe2\x88\x9714\xe2\x88\x971)+(2\xe2\x88\x9722\xe2\x88\x972)=88\n3rd3rd and 4th4th asteroid can be shot by blaster 22:\nCost=(5\xe2\x88\x9715\xe2\x88\x971)+(3\xe2\x88\x9723\xe2\x88\x972)=1111\n5th5th asteroid can be shot by blaster 33:\nCost=(9\xe2\x88\x9719\xe2\x88\x971)=99\nTherefore, Total Cost = 8+11+98+11+9 = 2828.\nIt can be verified that any other possible combination results in a larger cost.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85dharsan_r\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ASTR2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dharsan_r, greedy, heli2021\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

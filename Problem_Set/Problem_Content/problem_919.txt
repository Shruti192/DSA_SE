Each package must contain the same number of cupcakes. Chef will choose an integer A between 1 and N, inclusive, and place exactly A cupcakes into each package.  Chef makes as many packages as possible. Chef then gets to eat the remaining cupcakes. Chef enjoys eating cupcakes very much. Help Chef choose the package size A that will let him eat as many cupcakes as possible.\n\nInput\n\nInput begins with an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer N, the number of cupcakes.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the package size that will maximize the number of leftover cupcakes. If multiple package sizes will result in the same number of leftover cupcakes, print the largest such size.\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000000 (108)\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the first test case, there will be no leftover cupcakes regardless of the size Chef chooses, so he chooses the largest possible size.  In the second test case, there will be 2 leftover cupcakes.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndavid_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anton_lunyov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MUFFINS3\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Integer Division, Arithmetic\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1023\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-11-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

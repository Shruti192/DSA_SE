b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree with N nodes. You would like to paint each node of the tree in one of three possible colors: red, green, and blue. The following conditions must be fulfilled:\n\n\nFor each node painted red, there must be no more than R red nodes in its subtree (including this node).\n\n\nFor each node painted green, there must be no more than G green nodes in its subtree (including this node).\n\n\nFor each node painted blue, there must be no more than B blue nodes in it's subtree (including this node).\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the number of ways to paint the tree and output it modulo 1000000007.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains four integers N, R, G and B. \nThe following N-1 lines contain pairs of the nodes' numbers Ui and Vi (one pair per line), describing the edges of the tree.\n\nThe nodes are numbered from 1 to N, inclusive, and the node with the index 1 is the root of the tree.\n\nOutput\nOutput the answer to the problem on the first line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 300\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 R, G, B \xe2\x89\xa4 300\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput #1:\n3 1 1 1\n1 2\n3 1\n\nOutput #1:\n12\n\n\n\nInput #2:\n8 2 1 3\n1 2\n1 4\n5 4\n7 4\n3 2\n4 6\n8 6\n\nOutput #2:\n613\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREERGB\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP on Trees\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3519\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-08-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

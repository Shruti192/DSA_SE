b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef lives in a country that uses coins of NN denominations. For each valid ii, one coin of denomination ii is worth DiDi cents.\nA bus ticket, when bought from the driver, costs PP cents and can be paid for only with coins. Moreover, to save time, bus drivers never give back any change.\nChef is wondering if it is possible that someone would have enough coins to buy a ticket, but would be forced to overpay for it (pay more than PP cents), or if it is always possible to pay exactly PP cents when it is possible to buy a ticket, regardless of the values of the coins the person buying the ticket has.\nIf it is possible to be forced to overpay, please find any such example \xe2\x80\x95 any multiset of coins such that in total, they are worth strictly more than PP cents, but if any coin is removed from this multiset, the total worth of the remaining coins is strictly smaller than PP.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and PP.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers D1,D2,\xe2\x80\xa6,DND1,D2,\xe2\x80\xa6,DN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible for someone to be forced to overpay, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print a single line containing the string "YES", followed by a space and NN space-separated integers C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CNC1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CN such that:\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nP<S=\xe2\x88\x91Ni=1Ci\xe2\x8b\x85DiP<S=\xe2\x88\x91i=1NCi\xe2\x8b\x85Di\nfor each valid ii, if Ci>0Ci>0, then S\xe2\x88\x92Di<PS\xe2\x88\x92Di<P\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D1<D2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<DN\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4D1<D2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<DN\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (8 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa450T\xe2\x89\xa450\nN\xe2\x89\xa45N\xe2\x89\xa45\nP\xe2\x89\xa420P\xe2\x89\xa420\nDi\xe2\x89\xa420Di\xe2\x89\xa420 for each valid ii\n\nSubtask #2 (24 points):\n\nP\xe2\x89\xa4103P\xe2\x89\xa4103\nDi\xe2\x89\xa4103Di\xe2\x89\xa4103 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 104104\n\nSubtask #3 (68 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n3\n2 10\n1 5\n2 4\n1 5\n3 25\n3 5 10\n\nExample Output\nNO\nYES 0 1\nYES 2 0 2\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: No matter how many 55-cent coins and how many 11-cent coins a person has, if the total sum is at least 1010, they will always be able to pay precisely 1010 cents without requiring any change.\nExample case 2: If a person has a single 55-cent coin and nothing else, they will not be able to pay precisely 44 cents and will be forced to overpay by giving away his only coin.\nExample case 3: If a person has two 33-cent coins, two 1010-cent coins and no 55-cent coins, then the only way to pay 2525 cents is by giving away all the coins. They are worth 2626 cents in total, so this person is forced to overpay by 11 cent.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alex_2oo8\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NOCHANGE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

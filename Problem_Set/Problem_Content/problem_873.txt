b'\nThere exist a 2-Dimensional rectangular field of  infinite length and breadth. \nN Iron Blocks are dropped onto this field from the sky at particular coordinates. However, it is made sure that only one block is dropped at a particular coordinate. \nYou are standing at a particular location (X, Y) of the field. \nYou have a magnet with a power M in your hand. A magnet of power M at coordinates (x1, y1) can attract an iron block at (x2, y2) to its own location if max(abs(x1 - x2), abs(y1 - y2)) \xe2\x89\xa4 M. (abs represents the absolute value function)  \nGiven queries containing your position (X,Y) and the value K. Your task is to find the minimum power of magnet you require to get at least K blocks to your own location. \nIf it is not possible to get K blocks, output -1 for that case.\n \nInput\n\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer N denoting number of blocks. Then follow N lines, ith line contains two integers x and y denoting the x and y coordinate of ith block\n\n\nNext line contains an integer Q denoting number of queries.\n\n\nThen follow Q lines, each line contains three integers X,Y and K, X and Y denoting your position and K denoting the number of blocks you need to bring to your position.\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\n\nQ lines containing answers to each of the queries in the input\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 3000\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q  \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Any X or Y Co-ordinate  \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K  \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3\n1 1\n2 2\n3 1\n4\n2 3 1\n2 2 1\n3 2 1\n3 3 4\n\nOutput:\n1\n0\n1\n-1\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\n\nQuery 1: Using a magnet of power 1, block at (2, 2) can be brought to (2, 3).\n\nQuery 2: Using a magnet of power 0, block at (2, 2) can be brought to (2, 2).\n\nQuery 3: Using a magnet of power 1, blocks at (2, 2) and (3, 1) can be brought to (3, 2).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85amanmittal\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INSQ15_H\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 amanmittal, binary-search, dynamic-programming, insq2015\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-09-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

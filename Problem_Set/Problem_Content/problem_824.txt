b'\n\xc2\xa0\nBatman has devised a plan to lure Superman to a high rise building. His brilliant plan is to pour concrete over him to immobilize him, and then throw him off the building so that the concrete breaks leaving a shocked and wounded Superman exposed on the ground below for further attack. However, he realizes that the concrete may not break making the feat unimpressive, or if he went too high the fall would kill his enemy, which he can never do. So he decides to carry out trials with many identical Superman-sized concrete blocks to find out the minimum floor from which if thrown the block will break when it hits the ground below. He wants to know what is the maximum number of times he will have to drop a block from the building if he uses an optimal method to determine the critical floor from and above which the blocks always break. \nNOTE:\xc2\xa0A block which did not break after falling can be reused. It is possible that block may not break even when thrown from the highest floor.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains a single line with two integers N and H denoting the number of concrete blocks Batman has prepared and the number of floors of the building respectively.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output one line containing a single integer denoting the answer.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 H \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n1\n1 10\n\nOutput:\n10\n\nExplanation\nBatman has no choice but to drop his single concrete block from each floor starting from the bottom until it breaks or he reaches the top floor.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85nib_ir\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLDROP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cole2016, dynamic-programming, easy-medium, nib_ir\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

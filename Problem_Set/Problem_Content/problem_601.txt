At any time, the pen may be placed above a point (x,y)(x,y) on the paper or touching it at a point (x,y)(x,y); in both cases, we call the point (x,y)(x,y) the position of the pen. The initial position of the pen is (0,0)(0,0).\nYou may perform the following types of actions:\n\nmove the pen down until it touches the paper\nlift the pen (if it was touching the paper); after this action, the pen is not touching the paper\nmove the pen from its current position (x,y)(x,y) to (x\xe2\x88\x921,y)(x\xe2\x88\x921,y) or (x+1,y)(x+1,y)\nmove the pen from its current position (0,y)(0,y) to (0,y+1)(0,y+1)\n\nActions of the first two types take no time, an action of the third type takes 11 second and an action of the fourth type takes 11 second. Each action may be performed any number of times. You may only move the pen for at most PP seconds in total.\nWhenever the pen is moved from (x1,y1)(x1,y1) to (x2,y2)(x2,y2) while touching the paper, it draws a line segment between these points (inclusive). Drawing over a line segment repeatedly is allowed.\nYou are given NN special line segments; each of them is parallel with the xx-axis. A special line segment is fully drawn if each point belonging to it also belongs to some drawn line segment. Your goal is to fully draw as many special line segments as possible in PP seconds. How many can you fully draw?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and PP.\nEach of the next NN lines contains three space-separated integers yy, ss and ee denoting a special line segment between points (s,y)(s,y) and (e,y)(e,y) (including these points).\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of special segments you can fully draw.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4151\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa415\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4e\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4e\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa42,0000\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nthe special line segments do not touch or intersect\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1 2\n0 1 2\n3 13\n1 1 2\n3 1 3\n1 3 4\n3 14\n1 1 2\n3 1 3\n1 3 4\n4 10\n1 3 4\n1 1 2\n2 1 2\n2 3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85arpa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DLINE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2526\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-12-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

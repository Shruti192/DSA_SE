He bakes very nice cakes so the number of buyers of cake in his shop is sometimes record breaking.\nNarayan is given the no. of buyers at his shop on N consecutive days. The number of buyers on the i-th day is Bi . A day is record braking if it satisfies both of the following conditions:\n\nThe number of buyer on the day is strictly larger than the number of buyers on each of the previous days.\nEither it is the last day, or the number of buyers on the day is strictly larger than the number of byers on the following day. \n\nNote that the very first day could be a record breaking day!\nYou have been a very good friend of Narayan since childhood,please  help him find out the number of record breaking days.\nInput\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.\nT test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N.\nThe second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Bi.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output one line containing y, where y is the number of record\nbreaking days.\nConstraints\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Bi \xe2\x89\xa4 2 \xc3\x97 10^5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000.\nSample Input\n4\n8\n1 2 0 7 2 0 2 0\n6\n4 8 15 16 23 42\n9\n3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5\n6\n9 9 9 9 9 9  \nSample Output\n2\n1\n3\n0  \nExplanation\nIn Sample Case #1, the bold and underlined numbers in the following represent the\nrecord breaking days: 1 2 0 7 2 0 2 0.\nIn Sample Case #2, only the last day is a record breaking day.\nIn Sample Case #3, the first, the third, and the sixth days are record breaking days\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85rnkjoshi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INNOV103\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 greedy, inno2020, medium, rnkjoshi\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-09-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

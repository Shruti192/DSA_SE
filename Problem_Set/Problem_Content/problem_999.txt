b"\nMario transforms each time he eats a mushroom as follows:\n\nIf he is currently small, he turns normal.\nIf he is currently normal, he turns huge.\nIf he is currently huge, he turns small.\n\nGiven that Mario was initially normal, find his size after eating XX mushrooms.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain one integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line of input, containing one integer XX.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line Mario's size after eating XX mushrooms.\nPrint:\n\nNORMALNORMAL, if his final size is normal.\nHUGEHUGE, if his final size is huge.\nSMALLSMALL, if his final size is small.\n\nYou may print each character of the answer in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings HugeHuge, hUgEhUgE, hugehuge and HUGEHUGE will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n4\n12\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nSMALL\nHUGE\nNORMAL\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: Mario's initial size is normal. On eating the first mushroom, he turns huge. On eating the second mushroom, he turns small.\nTest case 22: Mario's initial size is normal. On eating the first mushroom, he turns huge. On eating the second mushroom, he turns small. On eating the third mushroom, he turns normal. On eating the fourth mushroom, he turns huge.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85notsoloud\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRANSFORM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, cakewalk, ltime107, ltime107, math, math, notsoloud\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n649\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

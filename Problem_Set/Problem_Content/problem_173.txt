b"\nTHE CROFTS GAME\nLara and Jonah were onto Siberia for the expedition of the divine source. The flight was of 9 hours. To kill the time, they both decided to play a game. The rules of the game are simple.\nThe game starts with two n-integer arrays, A and B, and is played by two players. (here Lara and Jonah)\nBoth Lara and Jonah play in alternating turns, with Lara always playing first. During each turn, the current player must choose an integer i, (such that 0 <= i <= n \xe2\x80\x93 1). If the current player is Lara, then she receives A[i] points; if the current player is Jonah, then he receives B[i] points.\nEach value of \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99 can be chosen only once, either by Lara or Jonah, not both. The game always ends after n moves.\nThe player with the maximum number of points wins.\nTASK\nGiven the values of n, A, and B, can you determine the outcome of the game? \nPrint \xe2\x80\x98First\xe2\x80\x99 if Lara will win, \nPrint \xe2\x80\x98Second\xe2\x80\x99 if Jonah will win, \nPrint 'Tie\xe2\x80\x99 if they will tie. \nAssume both players always play optimally.\nINPUT FORMAT:\nThe first line of input contains a single integer, TestCases, denoting the number of test cases. Each of the 3 subsequent lines describes a test case. A single test case is defined over the following three lines:\n1. An integer, n, denoting the number of elements in arrays A and B.\n2. n space-separated integers, A0, A1, A2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6An-1, where each Ai describes the element at index i of array A.\n3. n space-separated integers, B0, B1, B2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6Bn-1, where each Bi describes the element at index i of array B.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1 <= TestCases <= 10 \n1 <= n <= 1000 \n1 <= Ai, Bi <= 105 \n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nFor each test case, print one of the following predicted outcomes of the game on a new line:\nPrint \xe2\x80\x98First\xe2\x80\x99 if Lara will win, \nPrint \xe2\x80\x98Second\xe2\x80\x99 if Jonah will win, \nPrint \xe2\x80\x98Tie\xe2\x80\x99 if they will tie. \n\nINPUT:\n3\n3\n1 3 4\n5 3 1\n2\n1 1\n1 1\n2\n2 2\n3 3\n\nOUTPUT:\nFirst\nTie\nSecond\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nTestCase 1:\n A = {1,3,4}, B = {5,3,1}. Lara and Jonah make the following n moves:\n       1. Lara chooses i = 2 and receives 4 points.\n       2. Jonah chooses i = 0 and receives 5 points. Note that Jonah will not choose i = 1, because this would\n           cause Lara to win. \n       3. Lara chooses i = 1 (which is the only remaining move) and receives 3 points.\n\nAs all n = 3 moves have been made, the game ends. Lara's score is 7 points and Jonah's score is 5 points, so Lara is the winner and we print \xe2\x80\x98First\xe2\x80\x99 on a new line.\n\nTestCase 2:\n A = {1,1}, B = {1,1}. Because both players will only make 1 move and all possible point values are 1, the players will end the game with equal scores. Thus, we print \xe2\x80\x98Tie\xe2\x80\x99 on a new line.\n\nTestCase 3:\n A = {2,2}, B = {3,3}. Because both players will only make 1 move and all the possible point values for Jonah are greater than all the possible point values for Lara, Jonah will win the game. Thus, we print \xe2\x80\x98Second\xe2\x80\x99 on a new line.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nprescient\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CROFT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, greedy, medium, prescient, sorting\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, NODEJS, BASH, JS\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

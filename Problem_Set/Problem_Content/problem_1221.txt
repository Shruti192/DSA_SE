b'\nPeople think that Gump is a genius, but the truth is that luck has always been on his side. No one knows how he always comes up with solutions to complex problems and becomes everyone\xe2\x80\x99s hero.\nHe has been challenged once again, and this time it\xe2\x80\x99s not that simple. He is given with the length NN and sum SS of a sequence AA of numbers, and he has to:\nStep 1: Find all possible sequences of numbers of length NN with sum SS\nStep 2: Find the products of all such sequences respectively\nStep 3: Print the maximum one\nGump is really busy this time, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time for this challenge, can you solve this one for him?\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, two space-separated integers NN and SS. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, follow the above mentioned steps and perform Step 3. Print it modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nN\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4109N\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4109\nAi>0,Ai>0, for each valid ii\nAiAi is a numbernumber, for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\n\n10 points:\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,S\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4N,S\xe2\x89\xa450\nS=\xce\xb1\xc3\x97NS=\xce\xb1\xc3\x97N, where \xce\xb1\xce\xb1 is a positive integerinteger\n90 points: original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n1\n3 6\n\nSample Output:\n8\n\nEXPLANATION:\nExample Case 1: The maximum product is found with the sequence [2,2,2][2,2,2].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ankushkhanna\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GUMP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ankushkhanna, ankushkhanna, binary-exponentation, cobe2019, easy-medium, math, modular-arith, modular-inv\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\n\nTomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much.\n\n\nSince Tomya has completed collecting the stamps in Ciel's restaurant, she now challenges the bonus game in her restaurant.\nThere are colored balls in a box.\nThe number of colors is N, and the number of balls color i in the box is Si for i = 1, 2, ..., N initially.\nAt first, Tomya has M coins.\nAnd Tomya's aim in this game is to get many coins at the end of the game.\nThis game will run as follows.\n\n\nTomya chooses a color, and Tomya bets some coins (suppose x coins are bet) on the color.\nHere x must be non-negative integer at most L, and Tomya must have x coins before betting.\nThen Ciel chooses a ball from the box, checks its color and discards the ball.\nIf the ball has the same color as Tomya's bet, then Tomya gets B\xc2\xb7x coins, otherwise Tomya must pay x coins. Note that, if Tomya wins, then she receives back her bet as well as B\xc2\xb7x coins.\nWhile the box has at least one ball, the above process are repeated.\nWhen the box is empty, the game is over.\n\n\nThe game is very kind, because Tomya always can increase her coins.\nInstead of this, Ciel is not kind in this game, she chooses the balls which minimize Tomya's coins at the end of the game (Yes, she can choose balls as she likes!).\nYour task is to calculate the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by Tomya at the end of the game.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains 4 integers N, B, M, L.\nThen the next line contains N integers S1, S2, ..., SN.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by Tomya at the end of the game.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, B \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M, L \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000000000 (1012)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Si \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n\nSample Input\n2\n2 1 30 100\n2 2\n3 1 1 58\n30 28 2\nSample Output\n80\n2\nExplanations\n\nIn the first sample, one of the strategy to obtain 80 coins is as follow:\nAt first, Tomya bets 0 coins. Let the color 2 be chosen by Ciel. (Now, S1 = 2, S2 = 1, Coins = 30)\nThen, Tomya bets 10 coins on the color 1.\n--- If the color 1 is chosen, she will get 10 coins.\n--- (Now, S1 = 1, S2 = 1, Coins = 40)\n------ In next turn, Tomya bets 0 coins, and let color 2 be chosen.\n------ (Now, S1 = 1, S2 = 0, Coins = 40)\n------ Lastly, Tomya bets all 40 coins on the color 1, and she will get 40 coins.\n------ (Game over with S1 = 0, S2 = 0, Coins = 80)\n--- If the color 2 is chosen in the second turn, she must lose 10 coins.\n--- (Now, S1 = 2, S2 = 0, Coins = 20)\n------ In this case, Tomya bets all 20 coins on the color 1, and she will get 20 coins.\n------ (Now, S1 = 1, S2 = 0, Coins = 40)\n------ Then, once more, Tomya bets all 40 coins on the color 1, and she will get 40 coins.\n------ (Game over with S1 = 0, S2 = 0, Coins = 80)\n\n\nIn the second sample, Tomya has only 1 coin.\nTherefore Tomya must not bet her coin while the box contains balls of at least 2 different colors.\nCiel must always choose a ball of the most popular color. So while the box has at least two balls there always exist two balls of different colors in the box.\nSo Tomya can bet her coin only on the last ball.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhiroto_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIELBALL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 binary-search, cook24, dynamic-programming, hard, hiroto_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n9999\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-07-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.579937 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nYou are given  sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.\nSuppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:\n5 4 4 2 2 8\n\nThen, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following: \n3 2 2 6\n\nThe above step is repeated until no sticks are left.\nGiven the length of  sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.\nNote: For each cut operation, you have to recalcuate the  length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).\nInput Format \nThe first line contains a single integer . \nThe next line contains  integers: a0, a1,...aN-1  separated by space, where  represents the length of the  stick.\nOutput Format \nFor each operation, print the number of sticks that are cut, on separate lines.  \nConstraints \n\n\n\n\nSample Input 0\n6\n5 4 4 2 2 8\n\nSample Output 0\n6\n4\n2\n1\n\nSample Input 1\n8\n1 2 3 4 3 3 2 1\n\nSample Output 1\n8\n6\n4\n1\n\nExplanation\nSample Case 0 : \nsticks-length        length-of-cut   sticks-cut\n5 4 4 2 2 8             2               6\n3 2 2 _ _ 6             2               4\n1 _ _ _ _ 4             1               2\n_ _ _ _ _ 3             3               1\n_ _ _ _ _ _           DONE            DONE\n\nSample Case 1\nsticks-length         length-of-cut   sticks-cut\n1 2 3 4 3 3 2 1         1               8\n_ 1 2 3 2 2 1 _         1               6\n_ _ 1 2 1 1 _ _         1               4\n_ _ _ 1 _ _ _ _         1               1\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _       DONE            DONE\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nhrupanjan\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CUTSTICK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, hrupanjan, math, solution\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n5000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, TEXT, NODEJS, RUBY, JS, FORT\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

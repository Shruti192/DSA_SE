In one round, all the players pick 11 tile each and place it in the tower.\nThe game is valid if:\n\nAll the players have a tile in each round;\nAll the tiles are used at the end.\n\nGiven NN and XX, find whether the game is valid.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers NN and XX representing the number of people at the party and the number of available tiles respectively.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line YESYES if the game is valid, else output NONO.\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeSYeS, yEsyEs, yesyes and YESYES will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,X\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4N,X\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 3\n4 2\n2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: The game will last for 11 round after which the tiles will finish.\nTest case 22: There are not enough Jenga tiles for everyone to place.\nTest case 33: The game will last for 22 rounds as after round 22 all Jenga tiles are used.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntejas_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/JENGA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, math, start35, tejas_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n613\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\n\xc2\xa0\nA cab owner have N number of cars all are running in city. He give a problem to his one employee.\nCab owner want to check whether a user can book a car or not which is inside or on  circle of radious K meter .\nIf User is at origin position (0,0). N cars position are given in (Xi,Yi) formate. Where 1<=i<=N .\nIf car can be booked give output as "Available" otherwise "Not Available" .\nAt that time employee is busy to solve other problem. Can you help him to solve this problem.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows."\nThen for each test case, The first line contains two integers N number of car active in city\nand K radious of circle within wich car are available or not.\nThe next N line contains space-separated integers Xi Yi  denoting the position (Xi,Yi) of ith car. \n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line "Available" if car can be booked otherwise "Not Available"..\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 100\n1 <= N <= 10^5\n1 <= K <= 5000\n-10^4 <= Xi <= 10^4\n-10^4 <= Yi <= 10^4\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4 5\n4 8\n3 4\n1 13\n-1 -5\n3 3\n1 5\n-3 4\n-4 -2\n\nOutput:\nAvailable\nNot Available\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\n\nIn the first test case N is 4 and K is 5  since position (3,4) will lie on circle of radious 5 and (-1,-5)\nis not inside the circle.\nIn the second test case N is 3 and K is 3 since not any position of lie on or inside the circle having radiou 3.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsintuuemisp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/UEMP01\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 math, processing, sintuuemisp\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-06-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, JS, WSPC\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

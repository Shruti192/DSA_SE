b"\n Read problems statements in Russian also.\nAfter visiting a childhood friend, Chef wants to get back to his home. Friend lives at the first street, and Chef himself lives at the N-th (and the last) street. Their city is a bit special: you can move from the X-th street to the Y-th street if and only if 1 <= Y - X <= K, where K is the integer value that is given to you. Chef wants to get to home in such a way that the product of all the visited streets' special numbers is minimal (including the first and the N-th street). Please, help him to find such a product. \nInput\nThe first line of input consists of two integer numbers - N and K - the number of streets and the value of K respectively. The second line consist of N numbers  - A1, A2, ..., AN respectively, where Ai equals to the special number of the i-th street.\nOutput\nPlease output the value of the minimal possible product, modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nExample\nInput:\n4 2\n1 2 3 4.\n\nOutput:\n8\n\n\nScoring\nSubtask 1 (30 points): N <= 80 \nSubtask 2 (70 points): See the constraints.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\nfurko_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHRL4\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Data Structures, Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2354\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-01-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

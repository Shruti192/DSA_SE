Chef convinced Weasel that the only way to get back in shape is to work out. Weasel decides to follow Chef\xe2\x80\x99s advice and has formulated the greatest workout plan - to reflect his love for histograms - in which he will go down the staircase every day. However, Weasel is not in the best shape, so, for starters, he can only go down at most K steps.\nFormally, a staircase is a set of adjacent rectangles with at most K changes of height. These rectangles should have either increasing or decreasing heights. The rectangles should start from the bottom (see images in the explanation section for clarification), and the height of rectangle at i-th position shouldn't be more than histogrami. \nFor each of the T cases, you have to find the greatest area of a staircase that matches the above-mentioned restrictions.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each of the T cases, you will be given two integers N, denoting the number of elements of the histogram, and K, the maximum number of steps, on the first line.\nFor each of the T cases, you will be given histogram array on the second line. \nOutput\nFor each test case you should print an integer, the maximum area of a staircase that satisfies Weasel's conditions.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nThe sum of N over all testcases does not exceed 105.\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 histogrami \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (10 points): K = 0.\nSubtask #2 (30 points): The sum of N over all testcases does not exceed 1,500.\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n5 2\n1 2 3 4 5\n5 3\n9 8 7 6 4\n5 1\n8 7 5 7 8\n4 10\n0 1 1 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n13\n33\n29\n2\n\n\nExplanation\n\nThe cells which form the staircase are colored with yellow. The discarded cells are colored with grey.\n\n\nCase 1:\nThe computed area is 1 + 2 \xc3\x97 2 + 4 \xc3\x97 2 = 13.  There are 2 changes of height: we start with a height of 1, we change to 2 and then we change to 4.\n\nCase 2:\nThe computed area is 9 + 7 \xc3\x97 2 + 6 + 4 = 33.\n\nCase 3:\nThe computed area is 7 \xc3\x97 2 + 5 \xc3\x97 3 = 29.\n\nHere is another possible solution:\n\nCase 4:\nWe take the second and the third cell. We have 0 changes in height. This is a viable solution because we can also have staircases with less than K\n changes.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85bciobanu\n\n\nTester:\njingbo_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WEASELSC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Persistent Convex Hull, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Data Structures, Persistent Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2879\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-08-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

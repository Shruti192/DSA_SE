Today Chef has 33 positive integers and he wonders if any one of them can be written as the sum of the other two integers.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain the number 55, which is the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains a single line of input, with three space-separated positive integers xx, yy, and zz. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line, "YES" if it\'s possible to represent any integer among the three integers as the sum of the other two integers, and "NO" if not. \nNOTE: The output is case insensitive, meaning both uppercase and lowercase characters can be used at any position of the output string.\nConstraints\n\n1<=x,y,z<=10001<=x,y,z<=1000\n\nSubtasks\n\n100% points - Original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 1 2\n1 3 2\n2 2 2\n100 100 201\n11 22 33\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nCase 1: For this case, the third integer can be written as the sum of the first two. 2=1+12=1+1\nCase 2: For this case, the second integer can be written as the sum of the first and third. 3=1+23=1+2\nCase 3: For this case, no integer can be written as the sum of other two.\nCase 4: For this case, no integer can be written as the sum of other two.\nCase 5: For this case, the third integer can be written as the sum of the first two. 33=11+2233=11+22\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SUMPOS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

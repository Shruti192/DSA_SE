For a sequence with even size, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sequence after sorting. For example, for a sequence A=[1,3,3,5,4,7,11]A=[1,3,3,5,4,7,11], the median is equal to 44, and for A=[2,3,4,5]A=[2,3,4,5], the median is equal to (3+4)/2=3.5(3+4)/2=3.5.\nFulu is a famous programmer in his country. He wrote the following program (given in pseudocode) for finding the median in a sequence AA with length NN:\nread(N)\nread(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])\nsort(A)\n# simultaneously remove elements A[K] and A[N mod K] from the array A\n# the order of the remaining N-2 elements is unchanged\nremove(A[K], A[N mod K])\nreturn A[(N-2)/2] # integer division\n\nThe program takes an integer KK as a parameter. Fulu can choose this integer arbitrarily between 11 and N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 inclusive.\nLittle Lima, Fulu's friend, thinks Fulu's program is wrong (as always). As finding one counterexample would be an easy task for Lima (he has already found the sequence A=[34,23,35,514]A=[34,23,35,514], which is a counterexample for any K\xe2\x89\xa43K\xe2\x89\xa43), Lima decided to make hacking more interesting. Fulu should give him four parameters S,K,m,MS,K,m,M (in addition to NN) and Lima should find the lexicographically smallest proper sequence AA with length NN as a counterexample.\nWe say that a sequence AA with length NN (00-indexed) is proper if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\nit contains only positive integers\nA0+A1+A2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+AN\xe2\x88\x921=SA0+A1+A2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+AN\xe2\x88\x921=S\nm\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Mm\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4M for each 0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N\nthe number returned by Fulu's program, ran with the given parameter KK, is different from the correct median of the sequence AA\n\nCan you help Lima find the lexicographically smallest counterexample or determine that Fulu's program works perfectly for the given parameters?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers NN, SS, KK, mm and MM.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, if there is no proper sequence, print a single line containing the integer \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921; otherwise, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 the lexicographically smallest proper sequence.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa481\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa48\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41053\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4S1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4S\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 6 1 1 5\n4 4 2 1 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 1 4\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: For the sequence A=[1,1,4]A=[1,1,4], it is already sorted, so the program would just remove the first two elements (K=1K=1, N%K=0N%K=0) and return the only remaining element 44. Obviously, the median of the original sequence is 11. It can be shown that there is no lexicographically smaller proper sequence.\nExample case 2: The only possible sequence is A=[1,1,1,1]A=[1,1,1,1], which is not proper, since Fulu's program will give the correct answer 11 for it.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85allllekssssa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HACKFU\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3009\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nElections are coming soon. This year, two candidates passed to the final stage. One candidate is John Jackson and his opponent is Jack Johnson.\nDuring the elections, everyone can vote for their favourite candidate, but no one can vote for both candidates. Then, packs of votes which went to the same candidate are formed. You know that for John Jackson, there are NN packs containing A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN votes, and for Jack Johnson, there are MM packs containing B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BMB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BM votes.\nThe winner is the candidate that has strictly more votes than the other candidate; if both have the same number of votes, there is no winner. You are a friend of John Jackson and you want to help him win. To do that, you may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose two packs of votes that currently belong to different candidates and swap them, i.e. change the votes in each of these packs so that they would go to the other candidate.\nYou are very careful, so you want to perform as few swaps as possible. Find the smallest number of operations you need to perform or determine that it is impossible to make John Jackson win.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line contains MM space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BMB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BM.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of swaps needed to make John Jackson win, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 104104\nthe sum of MM over all test cases does not exceed 104104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nA1=A2=\xe2\x80\xa6=ANA1=A2=\xe2\x80\xa6=AN\nB1=B2=\xe2\x80\xa6=BMB1=B2=\xe2\x80\xa6=BM\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 3\n2 2\n5 5 5\n4 3\n1 3 2 4\n6 7 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can perform two swaps ? each time, we swap a pack of 22 votes from AA and a pack of 55 votes from BB. After that, John Jackson gets 5+5=105+5=10 votes and Jack Johnson gets 2+2+5=92+2+5=9 votes.\nExample case 2: We can swap the pack of 11 vote from AA and the pack of 88 votes from BB. After that, John Jackson gets 8+3+2+4=178+3+2+4=17 votes and Jack Johnson gets 6+7+1=146+7+1=14 votes.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85vegann\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FAIRELCT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Multiset\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Sets\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

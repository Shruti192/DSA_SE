Initially, there is a graph without edges, but there is a set SS containing N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 edges (numbered 11 through N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921) which should get added to the graph one by one.\nIn this process, N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 times, the following steps are performed:\n\nAn edge ee is chosen uniformly randomly from the current set SS.\nThis edge is added to the graph and removed from SS.\nThe coefficient of ee is set to the number of vertices in the connected component created by adding this edge.\n\nChef is wondering about the expected values of coefficients of the edges. Unfortunately, he does not have much time for such matters since he needs to prepare a superb cake for Chefina's birthday tomorrow.\nHelp Chef and for each edge, calculate the expected value of its coefficient modulo 998,244,353998,244,353. We can prove that each coefficient is a rational number; for a coefficient in the form P/QP/Q, where PP and QQ are positive integers and QQ is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353, you should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q\xe2\x88\x921 is the multiplicative inverse of QQ modulo 998,244,353998,244,353.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe following N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines describe the edges in SS. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that the ii-th edge connects vertices uu and vv.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be R\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921R\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353 for the coefficient of the ii-th edge.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,0002\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450,0002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe edges in SS form a tree\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 200,000200,000\n\nExample Input\n3\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n7\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n6 2\n7 3\n\nExample Output\n499122179 499122179\n831870297 3 831870297\n415935151 332748122 166374063 665496239 415935151 4\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nWith probability 1/21/2, the edge (1,2)(1,2) is added to the graph first and its coefficient is set to 22 (vertices 11 and 22 are in the connected component). Then, with probability 11, the edge (2,3)(2,3) is added and its coefficient is set to 33.\nWith probability 1/21/2, the edge (2,3)(2,3) is chosen first instead and its coefficient is set to 22. In this case, the coefficient of (1,2)(1,2) is then set to 33.\n\nThe expected value of the coefficient of the first edge is 2\xe2\x8b\x851/2+3\xe2\x8b\x851/2=5/22\xe2\x8b\x851/2+3\xe2\x8b\x851/2=5/2. For the second edge, it is the same.\nExample case 2: The expected values of the coefficients are 17/6,3,17/617/6,3,17/6.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85andrzej\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ANTUTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Centroid Decomposition, Expected Value, FFT, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Mathematics, Probability, Transformations, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3300\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

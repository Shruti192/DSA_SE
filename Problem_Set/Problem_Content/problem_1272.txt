b"\nFor the new semester, iIIIT has offered NN courses, ithith of which has AiAi credits. The administration has also put a maximum limit MM on the number of credits a student can do in a single semester.\nAs Kunal goes about to choose his courses, he would first like to find out the total number of ways in which he can select courses. That is, he would like to find out the number of subsets of these courses whose sum of credits is less than or equal to MM.\nHelp him find the number of such subsets. Note that the same integer - if on different positions - is counted differently.\nAs the answer can be quite large, print it modulo 18790481921879048192\nInput\n\nThe first line contains 2 integers NN and MM, the total number of courses available to choose from and the maximum number of credits a student can take in a semester.\nThe second line contains NN integers, ithith of which represents AiAi\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971031\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971031\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97103\n\nOutput\nPrint a single integer telling the number of subsets of courses which can be taken, modulo 18790481921879048192\nSample Input\n4 10\n1 1 8 9\n\nSample output\n11\n\nExplanation\nValid subsets are: {}, {1}, {1}, {1, 1}, {8}, {1, 8}, {1, 8}, {1, 1, 8}, {9}, {1, 9}, {1, 9}.\nHack case note\nFind the buggy solution to this problem on GitHub or Drive.\nThis problem is part of DeCode contest, wherein you are given a problem (as given above) and its buggy solution (link in contest announcement).

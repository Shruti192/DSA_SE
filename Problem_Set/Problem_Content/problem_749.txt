b'\nThere are KK travellers who want to travel through a country one after the other. The country is in the form of a 22-d grid and is divided into NN rows and MM columns, such that each cell of the grid can be considered to be a city. \nEach city is initially marked with either 0 or 1. Let city (i,j)(i,j) (the city at the intersection of the ithith row and jthjth column) be marked with number CijCij. If a traveller is in the city (i,j)(i,j), then \n\nIf Cij=0Cij=0 and j<Mj<M, then the traveller moves to city (i,j+1)(i,j+1) and at the same time CijCij is changed to 11.\nIf Cij=1Cij=1 and i<Ni<N, then the traveller moves to city (i+1,j)(i+1,j) and at the same time CijCij is changed to 00.\n\nIf the traveller cannot make a move from a city (i,j)(i,j), then this city is considered to be the destination of that traveller. Note that the marking (CijCij) of the destination cell is unchanged \xe2\x80\x94 please see the third sample test for an explained example.\nEach traveller starts their journey from city (1,1)(1,1), and all travellers (apart from the first) start their journey only once the previous one has reached their destination. Find the destination city of the KK-th traveller.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT, denoting the number of testcases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each testcase contains three space-separated integers N,MN,M, and KK \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows, number of columns, and number of travellers, respectively.\nThe following NN lines each contain a binary string of length MM, such that jj-th character of the ii-th string denotes the initial marking of city (i,j)(i,j), CijCij.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output in a single line two space-separated integers xx and yy, where city (x,y)(x,y) is the destination city of the KK-th traveller.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\nN\xe2\x8b\x85M\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105N\xe2\x8b\x85M\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of N\xe2\x8b\x85MN\xe2\x8b\x85M over all tescases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x851054\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 2 1\n10\n01\n2 2 1\n10\n10\n2 2 2\n11\n10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 2\n2 1\n2 2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: The first (and only) traveller moves along the following path: (1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2).\nTest case 22: The traveller moves along the following path: (1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1). Note that no move can be made from (2,1)(2,1) by the first traveller.\nTest case 33: The first traveller moves along the path (1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1). After this, the state of city (1,1)(1,1) changes to 00 while the states of the other cities remain unchanged.\nThe second traveller then moves along the path (1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(1,2)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(1,2)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85inov_360\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/XORTRV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, inov_360, medium, start31\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3096\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

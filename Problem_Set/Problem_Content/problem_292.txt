b'\nSteve is in a fight with Hydra. He has nn gun shots. He has to kill the enemy in order to rule their territory. But, he can only fire 11 or 22 shots at each move. He also wants the number of moves to be a multiple of an integer kk otherwise the gun will explode.\nHelp Steve to find the minimal number of moves to win the battle against Hydra by following the conditions given.\n\nInput:\nFirst line contains TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains two space separated integers nn, kk.\n\n*Note: Input file can be empty*\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output an integer i.e. minimal number of moves being a multiple of kk. If there is no way he can win the battle by following the condition, print \xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\n\nConstraints\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa410\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1(100 points): Original Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n2\n10 2\n3 5\n\nSample Output:\n6\n-1\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor the first case, Steve could win the battle in 6 moves with following sequence of steps: {2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1}. \nFor the second test, there are only three valid sequence of steps {2, 1}, {1, 2}, {1, 1, 1} with 2, 2, and 3 steps respectively.

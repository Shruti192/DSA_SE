b"\nIn the cursed land of earth where all crops are failing, Tom Cooper is trying to grow nn acres of crop this season, and he can grow one crop in an acre. Tom has two sets of nn crop seeds each. In the two sets, the two ithith crop seeds are the same type crop.\nThe first set of nn crop seeds are independent and each of them require their own preparation and can be grown independently. The ithith crop under this category will take a cost of xixi.\nThe second set of nn crops are genetically modified to withstand extreme conditions and even withstand the intense dust storms. But there is one thing: to allot a proper usage of resources, the crops are designed in such a way that the ithith crop can be directly grown without fertiliser or other resource if the genetically modified (i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i\xe2\x88\x921)th crop is grown: that is, for example, the waste material of the (i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i\xe2\x88\x921)th crop can be fertiliser for the ithith crop, etc. Thus he can grow the ithith crop in them in a constant cc cost along with a preparation cost of ckicki but if he has also grown the (i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i\xe2\x88\x921)th genetically modified crop, he can skip the preparation cost and grow the ithith crop in just cc cost.\nSince the world market expects a lot of variety in the crops available, Tom wants to maximize the number of different types of crops he grows. That is for example, Tom can grow only genetically modified crop 1 on all his fields. In that case, he grows 1 crop. Tom wants to maximize this number of crops he grows. Note that growing both genetically modified and normal versions of the same crop count as growing 1 crop only, and not 2.\nThus, Tom wants you to find out the maximum number of different crops he can grow, and the corresponding minimum cost at which he can grow n sets of crops.\nInput format\n\nThe first line contains TT, the number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the first line contains two numbers nn and cc.\nThe second line has nn integers x1x1,x2x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xnxn.\nThe third line has nn integers k1k1,k2k2,\xe2\x80\xa6,knkn.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x[i]\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4x[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k[i]\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4k[i]\xe2\x89\xa410\n\nOutput format\nFor each test case, output a line having two integers - the maximum number of different crops that can be grown, and the minimum cost that'll be taken for this set of crops.\nSample Input\n2\n5 3\n1 3 1 2 1\n1 1 1 1 2\n3 2\n100 100 100\n1 1 1\n\nSample Output\n5 8\n3 8\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85shriram_c253\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SOPC012\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 array, dynamic-programming, sapc2019, shriram_c253\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-12-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

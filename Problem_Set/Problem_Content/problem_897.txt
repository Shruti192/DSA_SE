b'\nChef and his girlfriend don\xe2\x80\x99t think alike and are poles apart. They are deciding on a restaurant to spend their date, but they cannot decide on one place. They have made this simple task of choosing a restaurant very complex. They have randomly given  a unique number to all N restaurants of tricity. For each K contiguous restaurants, Chef\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend has given Chef the task of finding the difference between increasing and decreasing subranges from left to right. Chef\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend has convoluted ideas and then she further herself finds the sum of all the values which Chef calculated and will go on a date with him only if the sum is a positive number (including 0). If the number calculated by Chef\xe2\x80\x99s grilfriend is negative then she will dump Chef and Chef will again be single. Your task is to find the sum which Chef\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend  calculates.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains  T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains two positive integers N and K.\nN distinct positive integers bi follow separated by space.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the sum which Chef calculates on a new line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 bi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n1\n5 3\n1 4 3 2 5\n\nOutput:\n-3\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

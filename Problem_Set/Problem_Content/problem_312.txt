b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN students standing in a row and numbered 11 through NN from left to right. You are given a string SS with length NN, where for each valid ii, the ii-th character of SS is 'x' if the ii-th student is a girl or 'y' if this student is a boy. Students standing next to each other in the row are friends.\nThe students are asked to form pairs for a dance competition. Each pair must consist of a boy and a girl. Two students can only form a pair if they are friends. Each student can only be part of at most one pair. What is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string SS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of pairs.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|S|=N|S|=N\nSS contains only characters 'x' and 'y'\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\nxy\nxyxxy\nyy\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There is only one possible pair: (first student, second student).\nExample case 2: One of the ways to form two pairs is: (first student, second student) and (fourth student, fifth student). \nAnother way to form two pairs is: (second student, third student) and (fourth student, fifth student).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85raja1999\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/XYSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1124\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

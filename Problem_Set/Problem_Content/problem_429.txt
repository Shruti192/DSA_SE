b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN points in a plane (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the coordinates of the ii-th point are (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi).\nWe want to remove all the points one by one; you should choose the order in which they are removed.\nWhenever a point is removed, we compute the area of the convex hull of the remaining points. Then, we define a penalty PP as twice the sum of all these areas. It can be proved that PP is an integer.\nLet MM be the penalty of an algorithm that always greedily chooses the point that minimises the area of the convex hull of the remaining points (if there is more than one such point, the point with the smallest XX-coordinate is chosen; if there is still more than one point, then the point with the smallest YY-coordinate is chosen). You are given this penalty. Your goal is to find a removal order that results in a smaller penalty.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer NN.\nNN lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers XiXi and YiYi.\nThe last line contains a single integer MM.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing NN space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 a permutation of the integers 11 through NN denoting the points in the order in which they should be removed.\nConstraints\n\nN=1024N=1024\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Xi,Yi\xe2\x89\xa45120\xe2\x89\xa4Xi,Yi\xe2\x89\xa4512 for each valid ii\n\nExample Input\n6\n1 0\n0 0\n0 1\n1 2\n2 1\n1 1\n5\n\nExample Output\n5 2 3 1 4 6\n\nExplanation\nThe points 11 through 66 are marked AA through FF in the following figure.\n\n\nAfter removing the point marked EE, the convex hull of the remaining points is the quadrilateral ABCDABCD.\nAfter the points BB and CC are also removed, the remaining points AA, FF and DD are collinear, so the convex hull has zero area.\n\nThe penalty PP is 2\xe2\x8b\x85(3/2+1+0+0+0)=52\xe2\x8b\x85(3/2+1+0+0+0)=5.\nTest Generation\nThere are four groups of test files and two test files in each group.\n\nIn each file in group 1, the coordinates of all points are chosen uniformly randomly and independently between 11 and 512512 inclusive.\nIn each file in group 2, the points are chosen in the following way:\nConsider the square SS whose lower left corner is (0,0)(0,0) and upper right corner is (512,512)(512,512).\nGenerate a set of points by repeating the following process:\nChoose two points PP and QQ with integer coordinates on the perimeter of SS uniformly randomly.\nConsider all points with integer coordinates on the line segment PQPQ.\nSort these points first by non-decreasing XX-coordinate and then by non-decreasing YY-coordinate.\nAdd these points to the set, in this order.\nThe process stops as soon as the set contains NN pairwise distinct points.\nIn each file in group 3, the points are generated similarly to group 2, but the points PP and QQ are always chosen uniformly randomly among all points with integer coordinates inside or on the perimeter of the square SS.\nIn each file in group 4, the points are generated similarly to group 2, but PP is always the point (256,256)(256,256).\n\nScoring\nIf P>MP>M, you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, the score of a test file is M\xe2\x88\x92PM\xe2\x88\x92P. The score of a submission is the sum of scores of all test files. Your goal is to maximise the score of your submission.\nThere are eight test files. During the contest, the displayed score will account for exactly one test file from each group, i.e. your score reflects your submission's performance on 50% (4/8) of the test files. However, if your program gets a non-AC verdict on any test file, your submission's verdict will be non-AC. In other words, an AC verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files. After the end of the contest, your score will be changed to include the sum of your program's scores over the other 4 test files.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DYNHUL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 alei, alei, challenge-problem, dynamic-programming, greedy, heuristic, july20, randomized\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3768\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

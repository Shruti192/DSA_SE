b'\nAfter Lee Sedol lost to Alpha GO AI, he meets his counterpart Garry Kasparov to \nfind solace. What started as a calm conversation soon turns into a heated argument\nas they decide to challenge themselves in a game of Konkatonka.\nIn the most common form of Konkatonka, a transparent box is kept and filled with plastic\n cubes marked with numbers 1 to M where M is a natural number. The players take \n    alternative turns until the end of the game. In each turn, a player picks a cube,\n    marked x and also all the cubes marked with divisors of x out of the box. The game\n goes on till all the cubes in the box are removed. The player to pick up the last cube \nremaining inside the box is the winner.\n\nInput\nFirst Line : a natural number t indicating the number of test cases\n    In each line of the test case, two integers are given separated by a single space.\n    The first integer M is the number of plastic cubes in the box. The second \n    integer represents the player who starts - "0" means Lee Sedol starts the game and \n    "1" means Garry Kasparov starts the game (0 and 1 are integers and are given\n    in quotes only for clarity). \n\n\nOutput\nEach line of the output should either contain "Lee Sedol wins." or "Garry Kasparov wins."\nIt is possible to determine a winner if both, Sedol and Kasparov play optimally\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n    1\n    1 0\n\nOutput:\n    Lee Sedol wins.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsuthirth\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PRPR4\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, math, proof, prpo2016, simple, suthirth\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

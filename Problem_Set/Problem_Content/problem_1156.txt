b'\nAlice and Bob are playing a game. At the start of the game, there are NN piles of stones, the ii-th of which has AiAi stones.\nAlice and Bob alternate moves. On their move, a player does the following:\n\nChoose one pile of stones, and discard the remaining N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 piles.\nPartition the stones in the chosen pile into exactly NN new piles of stones, each containing at least 11 stone. Note that this means that the number of piles is always NN.\n\nThe player who cannot make a move loses. Determine the winner of the game if Alice moves first.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nEach test case contains two lines of input.\nThe first line of each test case contains NN, the number of piles.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor every test case print exactly one line containing the answer \xe2\x80\x94 either "Alice" or "Bob" (without the quotes).\nYou can output Alice and Bob in any case (for example, the strings BOb, BOB, bob and boB will be recognized as a positive response)\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41018\nThe sum of NN over all test cases doesn\'t exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n5 7 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nAlice\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first move, Alice can select the first pile and divide it into 33 piles of sizes 2,22,2, and 11. After this, Bob cannot make a move since each pile has less than 33 stones.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85nprakhar\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PARTGAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Game Theory\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2803\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

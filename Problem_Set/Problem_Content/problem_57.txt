The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a string S describing the row with N cells.\nEach character is either '0' or '1', denoting an empty cell or a cell with a soldier respectively.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible number of seconds Limak will play the game.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105 (N denotes the length of the string S)\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (25 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nSubtask #2 (25 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2000\nSubtask #3 (50 points): Original constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n10100\n1100001\n000000000111\n001110100011010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n10\n0\n48\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1.\nThe initial string is 10100.\nThere are N = 5 cells.\nThere is one soldier in the first cell, and one soldier in the third cell.\nThe following scenario maximizes the total time:\n\nLimak chooses the soldier in the first cell.\nThis soldier can move only one cell to the right.\nIt takes 1 second to choose a soldier and 1 second for a soldier to move to the next cell (2 seconds in total).\nThe string is 01100 now.\nLimak has only one choice.\nHe must choose the soldier in the third cell because the other soldier can't move at all (the soldier in the second cell can't move to the right because the next cell is already occupied).\nChoosing a soldier takes 1 second.\nThe chosen soldier moves from the third cell to the fifth cell, which takes 2 seconds.\nThis operation takes 1 + 2 = 3 seconds in total.\nThe string is 01001 now.\nLimak has only one choice again.\nSince the soldier in the last row can't move further to the right, the soldier in the second cell must be chosen.\nHe will move 2 cells to the right.\nThis operation takes 1 + 2 = 3 seconds in total.\nThe string become 00011 and the game is over.\n\nThe total time is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.\nTest case 2.\nThe initial string is 1100001.\nThere is only one possible scenario:\n\n1100001 is changed to 1000011 in 5 seconds (1 second to choose a soldier and 4 seconds for the soldier to move 4 cells to the right).\n1000011 is changed to 0000111 in 5 seconds.\n\nThe total time is 5 + 5 = 10 seconds.\nTest case 3.\nThe game is over immediately because all soldiers occupy rightmost cells already.\nThe answer is 0.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85errichto\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ROWSOLD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1638\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-04-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a string SS containing only decimal digits (\'0\' through \'9\') and a number NN. Your task is to insert an arbitrary number (including zero) of plus signs \'+\' into SS in order to form a valid expression whose value is equal to NN.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a string SS, followed by a space and an integer NN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one string \xe2\x80\x94 your solution, i.e. the expression obtained after inserting some plus signs into SS. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.\nConstraints\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa45T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa41201\xe2\x89\xa4|S|\xe2\x89\xa4120\nN<=int(S)N<=int(S). Notes: int(S)int(S) is the integer value of SS, if we consider SS as an integer.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): N<106N<106\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n4\n15112 28\n120012 33\n123 123\n15489001 10549\n\nExample Output\n15+11+2\n1+20+012\n123\n1548+9001\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: SS is "15112" and N=28N=28. We can put a plus sign before the third character and another plus sign before the last character of this string to form the expression 15+11+215+11+2, which is equal to 2828.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\niloveksh\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 bignum, bound, branch, dynamic-programming, hard, iloveksh, iloveksh, june18\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3077\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-05-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

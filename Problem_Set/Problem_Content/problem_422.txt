b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN heaps of candies (numbered 11 through NN); for each valid ii, the ii-th of them contains exactly iKiK candies. You aim to partition these heaps between you and your friend in such a way that each heap is given to exactly one of you without being split among you.\nThe distribution should be as fair as possible. Formally, let\'s denote the total number of candies you get by AA and the total number of candies your friend gets by BB; your goal is to minimise |A\xe2\x88\x92B||A\xe2\x88\x92B|.\nFind the smallest possible value of |A\xe2\x88\x92B||A\xe2\x88\x92B| and assign the heaps to you and your friend in some way that minimises |A\xe2\x88\x92B||A\xe2\x88\x92B|. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer KK, which is common for all test cases.\nThe second line contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print two lines.\n\nThe first of these lines should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest value of |A\xe2\x88\x92B||A\xe2\x88\x92B| we can obtain.\nThe second line should contain NN characters describing your assignment of heaps. For each valid ii, the ii-th of them should be \'1\' if you want to give the ii-th heap to you or \'0\' if you want to give it to your friend.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa441\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa44\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851065\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points): K=1K=1\nSubtask #2 (10 points): K=2K=2\nSubtask #3 (15 points): K=3K=3\nSubtask #4 (70 points): K=4K=4\nExample Input 1\n2\n2\n4\n5\n\nExample Output 1\n2\n0001\n3\n01001\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are four heaps with sizes 11, 44, 99 and 1616 and two optimal assignments: either give the last heap to yourself and the rest to your friend or vice versa (so both "0001" and "1110" would be considered correct outputs). In both cases, |A\xe2\x88\x92B|=|16\xe2\x88\x92(1+4+9)|=2|A\xe2\x88\x92B|=|16\xe2\x88\x92(1+4+9)|=2.\nExample case 2: There are five heaps with sizes 11, 44, 99, 1616 and 2525. You can assign the second and fifth heap to yourself, and thus |A\xe2\x88\x92B|=|(25+4)\xe2\x88\x92(16+9+1)|=3|A\xe2\x88\x92B|=|(25+4)\xe2\x88\x92(16+9+1)|=3. It can be proved that this is the smallest possible value of |A\xe2\x88\x92B||A\xe2\x88\x92B|.\nExample Input 2\n4\n3\n5\n6\n9\n\nExample Output 2\n271\n00001\n317\n000001\n253\n000001110\n\nExplanation\nExample case 3: We have K=4K=4 and N=9N=9. The smallest value of |A\xe2\x88\x92B||A\xe2\x88\x92B| is |(64+74+84)\xe2\x88\x92(14+24+34+44+54+94)|=|7793\xe2\x88\x927540|=253|(64+74+84)\xe2\x88\x92(14+24+34+44+54+94)|=|7793\xe2\x88\x927540|=253.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85bohdan\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EQDIV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bit Manipulation, Binomial Theorem, Dynamic Programming, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algebra, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2480\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

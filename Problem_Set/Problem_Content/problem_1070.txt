b'\nYears after the Ishval Civil War, the Ishvalan refugees have now found a safe place for themselves which is a rectangular piece of land, surrounded by fences.\nThe land can be thought of as a 2d grid which extends NN units vertically and MM units horizontally. It is divided into NN horizontal rows, which are numbered from 11 to NN, as you move from top to bottom and into MM vertical columns numbered from 11 to MM, from left to right.\nThere are XX rivers flowing in a horizontal direction, each flowing in a different row and covering the entire row. Similarly, there are YY rivers flowing in a vertical direction, each flowing in a different column and covering the entire column.\nThe people want to build houses of dimensions S\xc3\x97SS\xc3\x97S on the remaining land.\nWhat is the maximum number of houses of the given dimensions that could be built on the remaining land, such that no part of any house is in a river and no two houses overlap?\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nFor each test case, the first line contains NN and MM.\nThen the second line contains XX , YY and SS denoting the number of rivers flowing horizontally, number of rivers flowing vertically and the dimension of the house.\nThe next line contains XX integers xixi denoting the indices of rows in which river flows horizontally.\nThe next line contains YY integers yiyi denoting the indices of columns in which the river flows vertically.\n\nNote: \n\nxixi and yiyi are given in increasing order.\nWhen XX or YY are zero, the line containing xixi and yiyi is skipped respectively in the input (instead of a blank line).\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the maximum number of houses that can be built.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4104 \n0\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4N \n0\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa4M0\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa4M \n1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,M)1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,M) \n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4N \n1\xe2\x89\xa4yj\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4yj\xe2\x89\xa4M \nxi>xi\xe2\x88\x921xi>xi\xe2\x88\x921 for all 2\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4X2\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4X\nyi>yi\xe2\x88\x921yi>yi\xe2\x88\x921 for all 2\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Y2\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Y\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n7 8\n1 2 2\n5\n4 8\n6 5\n2 0 1\n1 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n20\n\n\nExplanation\nThe given figure corresponds to the first test case.\n7 8\n1 2 2\n5\n4 8\n\n\nAs shown in the figure, the maximum number of houses of dimension 2\xc3\x9722\xc3\x972 that could be built on the remaining land is 66.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85sachin_yadav\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ISHVALA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Geometry, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1818\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-10-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nLittle Elephant from Zoo of Lviv has n (0-based numeration) blocks consisted of 1x1x1 cubes in such way that the size of i-th block is 1x1xAi. Each of the blocks also has a color, which is a positive integer. The color of i-th block is Ci. There will be no more than two blocks of the same color.\n\nLittle Elephant wants to stack the blocks in the stack. In order to do so, he choose some random permutation P of integers from 0 to n-1, inclusive, and stacks all the blocks in order of P, i. e. at first he stacks P0-th block, then P1-th and so on.\n\nAfter stacking Little Elephant has a sequence of size S consisted of cubes (0-based numeration) in order from the stack, where S = A0 + A1 + ... + An-1. Then he counts the number of such pairs of cubes with indices i and j that j - i = k and i-th cube has same color as j-th. Call this number as colorfulness of the corresponding permutation.\n\n Help Little Elephant and for a given n, k and the description of blocks find the expected colorfulness, considering that permutation P is chosen randomly.\n \nInput\nFirst line of the input contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains pair of integers n and k. Next n lines of each test case contain pairs of integers Ai and Ci.\n\nOutput\nIn T lines print T numbers - the answers for the corresponding test cases. Your answer will considered correct if it has at most 10-6 absolute or relative error.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ci \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n\n\nThere will be no three or more blocks of the same color in a single test case.\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n7 5\n3 1\n2 2\n2 1\n4 3\n1 2\n1 3\n4 4\n\nOutput:\n0.9095238\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LEBLOCKS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics, Expected Value, Dynamic Programming, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2333\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

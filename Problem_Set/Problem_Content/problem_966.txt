b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\nAre you fond of collecting some kind of stuff? Mike is crazy about collecting stamps. He is an active member of Stamp Collecting \xd0\xa1ommunity(SCC). \n\n\nSCC consists of N members which are fond of philately. A few days ago Mike argued with the others from SCC. Mike told them that all stamps of the members could be divided in such a way that i'th member would get i postage stamps. Now Mike wants to know if he was right. The next SCC meeting is tomorrow. Mike still has no answer.\n\n\nSo, help Mike! There are N members in the SCC, i'th member has Ci stamps in his collection. Your task is to determine if it is possible to redistribute C1 + C2 + ... + Cn stamps among the members of SCC thus that i'th member would get i stamps.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer N, denoting the number of members of SCC.\nThe second line contains N integers Ci, denoting the numbers of the stamps in the collection of i'th member.\nOutput\nThe first line should contain YES, if we can obtain the required division, otherwise NO.\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100 000;\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  Ci \xe2\x89\xa4 109.\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n7 4 1 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kostya_by\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85gerald\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DIVIDING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arithmetic\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1109\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-02-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

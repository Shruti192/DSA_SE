b"\nProblem Statement\nIt is 2042 and we are surrounded by cyborgs everywhere. Geneo is one such cyborg with a human body and an electronic brain. To monitor skills and health of Geneo he is posed with questions everyday. On one fine day Geneo was asked the following question.\nYou are given a string S of size N containing letters a to z. You are allowed to remove a character from the string and exchange it for a number signifying its position. i.e a -> 1, b -> 2, c -> 3, ... z -> 26. After some number of these operations you arrive at a final array A.\nPower P of any such array is defined as: count of letters - count of numbers + (sum of numbers/K) where K is a given integer and '/' denotes float division.\nGeneo has to find maximum possible power Pmax of such an array.You want to test if Geneo is right. For this you have to generate correct answers for the question.\nInput section\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a two space separated integers N and K.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string S of size N.\nOutput Section\nFor each test case, output a single line containing two space seperated integers a and b such that a / b = Pmax - the maximum possible power achievable after transformation and gcd(a,b) = 1.\nInput constraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n10 6\nabcdefghij\n10 1\nqwertyuiop\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10 1\n159 1\n\n\nExplanation\nFor the first test case, if we replace no character, we get an array comprising of letters only. This gives us the maximum power 10.\nFor the second test case, we get maximum power when we replace all the characters by respective numbers.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85likecs\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ICL1802\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, greedy, icl2018, likecs, likecs\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1769\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-02-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nThe Chef owns an apple farming business. He has been making a lot of money off it and over the years he has started to become more generous out of generosity this year our chef has decided to donate his apples.\nNow our chef wants to donate his apples in two cycles such that in each cycle he donates half of what he has (if he has an odd number of apples he donates the smaller portion).\nYou will be given the total number of apples he initially has and have to find the number of apples left with the chef after both the cycles of donation.\nConstraints:\n1<=TT<=100\n1<=NN<=100000 .\nHere NN  is the total number of apples he has initially.\nInput:\nThe first line contains a number TT the total number of testcases.\nThe next TT lines contain\nA single integer NN containing the total number of apples he has initially.\nOutput:\nA single integer which is the number of apples he has left.\nExample:\nInput:\n2\n3\n100                                                                                         \nOutput:\n1\n25                                                                                   \nExplanation 1:\nCycle 1: Chef has 3 apples initially he donates half which is 1.5 but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible so keeps the larger portion i.e 2 and donates 1.\nCycle 2: Chef has 2 apples now he donates half which is 1 Now he\xe2\x80\x99s left with 1 .\nExplanation 2:\nCycle 1: Chef has 100 apples initially he donates half which is 50 and keeps the rest 50.\n  Cycle 2: Chef has 50 apples now he donates half which is 25 Now he\xe2\x80\x99s left with 25 .\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85beast787\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFDON\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 beast787, cakewalk, math\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

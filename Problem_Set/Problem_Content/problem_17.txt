In FFL, each team consists of exactly 1515 players: 22 goalkeepers, 55 defenders, 55 midfielders and 33 forwards. Chef has already bought 1313 players; he is only missing one defender and one forward.\nThere are NN available players (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, the ii-th player is either a defender or a forward and has a price PiPi. The sum of prices of all players in a team must not exceed 100100 dollars and the players Chef bought already cost him SS dollars.\nCan you help Chef determine if he can complete the team by buying one defender and one forward in such a way that he does not exceed the total price limit?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and SS.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN.\nThe last line contains NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers is 00 if the ii-th player is a defender or 11 if the ii-th player is a forward.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if it is possible to build a complete team or "no" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n13\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa410013\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 90\n3 8 6 5\n0 1 1 0\n4 90\n5 7 6 5\n0 1 1 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nyes\nno\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: If Chef buys the 11-st and 33-rd player, the total price of his team is 90+9=9990+9=99, which is perfectly fine. There is no other valid way to pick two players.\nExample case 2: Chef cannot buy two players in such a way that all conditions are satisfied.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85s_h_shahin\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FFL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1225\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-04-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

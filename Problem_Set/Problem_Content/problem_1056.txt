b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well\nYou are given a binary string SS with length NN and an integer KK, which is a divisor of NN. A string is said to be KK-foldable if it can be changed to a string with length KK by repeating the following process without any collisions (defined below):\n\nSelect the prefix of the current string SS with length 2K2K. (Note that as long as the length of SS is greater than KK, this prefix always exists.)\nFor each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K), check if the 2K\xe2\x88\x92i+12K\xe2\x88\x92i+1-th character of SS is equal to the ii-th character of SS \xe2\x80\x95 if they are not equal, there is a collision and the process is invalid.\nErase the prefix of SS with length KK.\n\nYour goal is to reorder the characters of SS (possibly leaving this string unchanged) in such a way that the resulting string SS is a KK-foldable string. Find a way to do that or determine that it is impossible. If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest rearranged string which is KK-foldable.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.\nThe second line contains a single string SS with length NN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the smallest rearranged string or the string "IMPOSSIBLE" if it is impossible to rearrange SS.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nNN is divisible by KK\nSS contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n8 2\n00011101\n6 2\n100111\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n01100110\nIMPOSSIBLE\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: If the given string "00011101" is rearranged to "01100110", it becomes 22-foldable:\n\nInitially, SS is "01100110".\nAfter the first folding, it becomes "100110".\nAfter the second folding, it becomes "0110".\nAfter the third folding, it becomes "10". This string has length 22, so we are done.\n\nExample case 2: It is impossible to rearrange SS into a 22-foldable string.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85pandey__ji\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KFOLD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1742\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nAfter six days, professor GukiZ decided to give more candies to his students. Like last time, he has NN students, numbered 11 through NN. Let's denote the number of candies GukiZ gave to the ii-th student by pipi. As GukiZ has a lot of students, he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students. He only remembers the following properties of the sequence pp:\n\nThe numbers of candies given to each of the first KK students (p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pKp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pK) are known exactly.\nAll elements of the sequence pp are distinct and positive.\nGukiZ didn't give more than xx candies to any student (the maximum value in the sequence pp is not greater than xx).\nFor each student ii, there is at least one other student jj such that |pi\xe2\x88\x92pj|\xe2\x89\xa4D|pi\xe2\x88\x92pj|\xe2\x89\xa4D.\nThe professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies, i.e. S=p1+p2+p3+\xe2\x80\xa6+pNS=p1+p2+p3+\xe2\x80\xa6+pN is maximum possible.\n\nGukiZ would like to know the total number of candies SS he had at the beginning. However, times change and after six days, the professor is really tired, so it is possible that there is no sequence pp which satisfies the constraints. Can you help GukiZ find the number of candies he gave out, or tell him that he must have made a mistake?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers NN, KK, xx, DD.\nThe second line contains KK distinct space-separated integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pKp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pK.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of candies GukiZ had, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if there is no valid sequence pp.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41093\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,2\xe2\x8b\x85104)1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,2\xe2\x8b\x85104) \n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851091\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4x1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4x for each valid ii\nAll values pipi from input are distinct\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4x,N,D\xe2\x89\xa4151\xe2\x89\xa4x,N,D\xe2\x89\xa415 \nSubtask #2 (35 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4x,N,D\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4x,N,D\xe2\x89\xa4105 \nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 3 5 3\n2 1 5\n3 2 8 2\n3 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n12\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are four students. We know that the first student got p1=2p1=2 candies, the second student got p2=1p2=1 and the third got p3=5p3=5 candies; we don't know the number of candies given to the last student. The maximum possible amount of candies given to some student is x=5x=5. The best possible option is giving p4=4p4=4 candies to the last student. Then, the fourth constraint (with D=3D=3) is satisfied for all students. Only the pair of students (2,3)(2,3) have numbers of candies that differ by more than 33, but still, for each student, there are at least two other students with close enough numbers of candies.\nExample case 2: GukiZ made some mistake in distribution and there is no valid sequence pp. The answer is \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85allllekssssa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GHMC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Constructive, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2778\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

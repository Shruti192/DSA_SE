b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere's no story in this problem, it's time for trees!\nThe company structure of ShareChat can be viewed as a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN); node 11 is the root of this tree. You should choose a (possibly empty) subset of nodes and place one coin in each node from this set. We call the tree proper if the following condition holds:\n\nConsider two arbitrary disjont subtrees. Let's denote the total number of coins in one subtree by XX and the total number of coins in the other subtree by YY.\nIf X>0X>0 and Y>0Y>0, the greatest common divisior (GCD) of XX and YY must be 11.\n\nPlease calculate the number of different assignments of coins to nodes (different sets of nodes containing coins) such that the resulting tree is proper. Since the answer could be very big, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.\nNote: A subtree is the tree formed by some node vv and all (direct or indirect) descendants of vv. Two subtrees are disjont if they do not have any common node.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer NN denoting the number of nodes in the tree.\nThe second line contains N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pNp2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN, where pipi denotes the parent of node ii.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of assignments of coins to nodes which form a proper tree, modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4701\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa470\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i1\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i for each valid ii\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 1 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\nExplanation\nThere are only two ways to assign coins to nodes such that the resulting tree is not proper. Both contain coins in nodes 22, 33, 44, 55 and one of them contains a coin in node 11 too.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85allllekssssa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STTT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, Bitmasking, Combinatorics, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3206\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

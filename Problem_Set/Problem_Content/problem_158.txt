Find the lexicographically smallest sequence BB that satisfies the following conditions\n\nWe can obtain BB by rearranging the elements in AA.\nThe length of longest non-decreasing subsequence of BB is equal to KK.\n\nIf no such sequence exists, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line of the input contains TT, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains two space separated integers NN and KK.\nSecond line of each test case contains NN space separated integers describing the array AA.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the array BB in a single line with a space between two consecutive elements. And output \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if no such array BB exists.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N\nSum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 200200.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3 1\n2 1 3\n3 2\n2 1 3\n3 3\n2 1 3\n3 1\n2 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 2 1\n1 3 2\n1 2 3\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nThere are 66 arrays that are rearrangements of the array [2,1,3][2,1,3].\n\n[1,2,3][1,2,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 33.\n[1,3,2][1,3,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.\n[2,1,3][2,1,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.\n[2,3,1][2,3,1] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.\n[3,1,2][3,1,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.\n[3,2,1][3,2,1] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 11.\n\nTest case 1:\nObserve from the list above that [3,2,1][3,2,1] is the only rearrangement of [2,1,3][2,1,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 11. And hence [3,2,1][3,2,1] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.\nTest case 2:\nObserve from the above list the [1,3,2][1,3,2] is the lexicographically smallest among all those rearrangements with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22. And hence [1,3,2][1,3,2] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.\nTest case 3:\nObserve from the list above that [1,2,3][1,2,3] is the only rearrangement of [2,1,3][2,1,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 33. And hence [1,2,3][1,2,3] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.\nTest case 4:\nThere are only 33 possible ways to rearrange [2,2,3][2,2,3].\n\n[2,2,3][2,2,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 33.\n[2,3,2][2,3,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.\n[3,2,2][3,2,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 22.\n\nSo there does not exist any rearrangement of [2,2,3][2,2,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsuryaprak_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DECSUBK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Longest Increasing Subsequence, Greedy, Sorting, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP on sequences\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2796\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-11-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

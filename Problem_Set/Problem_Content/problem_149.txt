b'\nChefland is a 1D1D city where each of the NN houses is located at a distinct positive integer coordinate A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6AN. The chef is planning to create KK hills in the city. Note that two hills cannot be present at the same location but the location of hills and houses can overlap and each hill will also be at any integer (positive, negative or zero) coordinate. \nEach citizen would want to travel to the farthest hill from his house. Travelling will create air pollution and Chef wants to minimise the total pollution in the city. Help Chef find the minimum sum of distance travelled by everyone. In other words, help Chef create the hills at optimal locations, so that the sum of the distance of every house to the hill farthest from it is minimum possible.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains two lines of input.\nFirst line contains 22 integers N,KN,K separated by a space.\nSecond line contains NN integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, representing the location of the houses. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, find the minimum possible sum of distances if Chef creates the hills at optimal locations, in a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nAi<Ai+1\xe2\x88\x80Ai<Ai+1\xe2\x88\x80 valid ii\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 1\n1 2 3\n1 5\n1\n2 2\n1 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nTestCase 1: Optimal solution includes creating hill at 22. Its distance from the house at coordinate 11 is 11, and so is its distance from the house at coordinate 33. Its distance from the house at coordinate 22 is 00. Thus, total distance is 1+0+1=21+0+1=2.\nTestCase 2: Optimal solution includes creating hills at {\xe2\x88\x921,0,1,2,3}{\xe2\x88\x921,0,1,2,3}. The farthest hills from the house at coordinate 11 are at coordinates \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 and 33. The citizen can choose to travel to any of them, and the distance shall be 22.\nTestCase 3: Optimal solution includes creating hills at {1,2}{1,2} or {4,5}{4,5}.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsmit_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHILLS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, greedy, observation, smit_adm, start3, vichitr\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2460\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

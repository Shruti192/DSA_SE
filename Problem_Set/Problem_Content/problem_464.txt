b"\nShaun was given NN pairs of parenthesis ( )  by his teacher who gave him a difficult task.The task consists of two steps. First,Shaun should colour all NN pairs of parenthesis each with different color but opening and closing bracket of a particular pair should be of same colour. Then,Shaun should report to his teacher the number of ways he can arrange all 2\xe2\x88\x97N2\xe2\x88\x97N brackets such that sequence form is valid. Teacher defined valid sequence by these rules:\n\nAny left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.\nAny right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.\nLeft parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'. \n\nNote: Shaun could match opening and closing brackets of different colours. \nSince number of ways can be large, Shaun would report the answer as modulo 1000000007 (109+7109+7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer NN. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Shaun to his teacher modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n\nSample Input:\n   3\n   1\n   2\n   3\n\nSample Output:\n   1\n   6\n   90\n\nEXPLANATION:\nHere numbers from 11 to NN have been used to denote parenthesis.A unique number corresponds to a unique pair of parenthesis.\n-In the first test case , you can use only one color to color the parenthesis  you could arrange it only in one way i.e, 1 1\n-In the second test case  you can use two colors and the possible ways of arranging it are\n1 1 2 2\n1 2 2 1\n1 2 1 2\n2 2 1 1\n2 1 1 2\n2 1 2 1\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85yashu2040\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COCA2003\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 basic, coca2020, combinatorics, dynamic-programming, yashu2040\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nFor a string S, let\'s define a function F(S) as the minimum number of blocks consisting of consecutive identical characters in S. In other words, F(S) is equal to 1 plus the number of valid indices i such that Si \xe2\x89\xa0 Si+1.\nYou are given two strings A and B with lengths N and M respectively. You should merge these two strings into one string C with length N+M. Specifically, each character of C should come either from A or B; all characters from A should be in the same relative order in C as in A and all characters from B should be in the same relative order in C as in B.\nCompute the minimum possible value of F(C).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nThe second line contains a single string A with length N.\nThe third line contains a single string B with length M.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible value of F(C).\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 5,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N in all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 5,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of M in all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 5,000\nstrings A, B consist only of lowercase English letters\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (10 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\n\nSubtask 2 (20 points): the characters of A and B are sorted in non-decreasing order\n\n\nSubtask 3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 4\nabab\nbaba\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One possible way to choose the string C to get the desired answer is "abbaabba".\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STRMRG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1965\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

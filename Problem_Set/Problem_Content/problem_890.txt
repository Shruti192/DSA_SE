b'\nThere is going to be a major fair in Government College Of Engineering Nagpur \xe2\x80\x93 GCOEN  Named as Adhyaaya . In which there are many events going to happen. There are nn numbers of events you can attend. You know its starting and ending days and the amount of money you could win in the event.But the condition is that you can attend only one event in a day. Tell the maximum amount of money you will win.\nInput Format\n\nThe first input line contains an integer nn: the number of events.\nAfter this, there are n lines. Each such line has three integers aa,bb, and mm: the starting day, the ending day, and the money .\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint one integer: the maximum amount of money you can earn.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 2\xe2\x88\x97105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a \xe2\x89\xa4 b \xe2\x89\xa4109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nSubtasks\n\n100 points : All Constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 4 4\n3 6 6\n6 8 2\n5 7 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nExplanation\n                    In the given test case, There are 4 events in which you can participate \n-   first event will start on day 2 and end on day 4 \n-   second event will start on day 3 and end on day 6 \n-   Third event will start on day 6 and end on day 8 \n-   Fourth event will start on day 5 and end on day 7 \nSo, first event and third , first event and fourth event are the only 2 events whose days are not co-inciding. [2,4] && [6,8] and [2,4] && [5,7] respectively.  \nif we add prizes of 2 events , we will get prize of (4+2 = 6) in first condition and (4+3 =7) in second condition, so we will print max of them i.e 7.\n  \n                \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85pratik291219\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85karanarjunjr\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GCOEN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, medium, pratik291219\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-02-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

For example, the maximum 2-product of the array  [-5, 3, 4, -6] is 30 because the product of the subsequence [-5, -6] is 30 and it is impossible to achieve larger subsequence product.\nWhat is the maximum K-product you can achieve? Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 109 + 7.\nNote:  Recall that the result of a modulo operation is always non-negative. For example, -8 mod 5 = 2.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, denoting the elements of the array. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the maximum K-product of the array.\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n-109 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nThe sum of the Ns over all the test cases in a single test file is \xe2\x89\xa4 5\xc3\x97105\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\n4 2\n5 -3 -4 6\n4 2\n-5 3 4 -6\n3 2\n10000 100000 100000\n2 1\n-1 -2\n\nOutput:\n30\n30\n999999937\n1000000006\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The maximum 2-product of the array [5, -3, -4, 6] is 30 and is achieved by the subsequence [5, 6].\nExample case 2. The maximum 2-product of the array [-5, 3, 4, -6] is 30 and is achieved by the subsequence [-5, -6].\nExample case 3. The maximum 2-product of the array [10000, 100000, 100000] is 10000000000 and is achieved by the subsequence [100000,100000]. Modulo 109 + 7, this is 999999937.\nExample case 4. The maximum 1-product of the array [-1, -2] is -1 and is achieved by the subsequence [-1]. Modulo 109 + 7, this is 1000000006.\nThe reason why -1 mod (109 + 7) = 1000000006 is that for positive m, a mod m is defined as the smallest nonnegative integer b such that a - b is divisible by m.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MMPROD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-06-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

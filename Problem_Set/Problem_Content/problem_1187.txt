He has R\xe2\x88\x92L+1R\xe2\x88\x92L+1 spaghetti: exactly one spaghetti with each length between LL and RR inclusive.\nChef decided to take some of his spaghetti and stick them together to form one very long spaghetti. The length of this spaghetti is the sum of the lengths of the spaghetti he took. In particular, he may take all spaghetti and he may take only one spaghetti as well. How many different spaghetti can he make?\nTwo spaghetti are considered different if their lengths are different.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers LL and RR.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of different spaghetti Chef can make.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L,R\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4L,R\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points): L=1L=1\nSubtask #2 (55 points): L,R\xe2\x89\xa4104L,R\xe2\x89\xa4104\nSubtask #3 (20 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 2\n3 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mohammed200218\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDSUMS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2588\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nIt is well-known that the elephants are afraid of mouses. The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv is not an exception.\n\nThe Little Elephant is on a board A of n rows and m columns (0-based numeration). At the beginning he is in cell with coordinates (0; 0) and he wants to go to cell with coordinates (n-1; m-1). From cell (x; y) Little Elephant can go either to (x+1; y) or (x; y+1).\n\nEach cell of the board contains either 1 or 0. If A[i][j] = 1, then there is a single mouse in cell (i; j). Mouse at cell (i; j) scared Little Elephants if and only if during the path there was at least one such cell (x; y) (which belongs to that path) and |i-x| + |j-y| <= 1.\n\nLittle Elephant wants to find some correct path from (0; 0) to (n-1; m-1) such that the number of mouses that have scared the Little Elephant is minimal possible. Print that number.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contain pair of integers n and m - the size of the board. Next n lines contain n strings, each of size m and consisted of digits 0 and 1.\n\nOutput\nIn T lines print T integer - the answers for the corresponding test.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 50\n\n2 <= n, m <= 100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 9\n001000001\n111111010\n100100100\n7 9\n010101110\n110110111\n010011111\n100100000\n000010100\n011011000\n000100101\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n9\n10\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: \nThe optimized path is: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (2, 8). The mouses that scared the Little Elephant are at the following cells: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (0, 2), (0, 8).\n\nExample case 2: \nThe optimized path is: (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 8). The 10 mouses that scared the Little Elephant are at the following cells: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (6, 8).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85tuananh93\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LEMOUSE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1941\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-03-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

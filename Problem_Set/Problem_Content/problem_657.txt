b"\nThe ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) has recently built a supercomputer with the help of C-DAC (Center for Development of Advanced Computing), for processing data generated from MOM (Mars Orbiter Mission). Before using it for real data, they want to test it out with the following problem, as they feel it is very hard for a normal computer to solve this problem.\nGiven a number N, find the sum of f(x) for all x such that 1 <= x <= N.\nf(x) is defined as the sum of all digits in base 10 representation of the number x.\nFor example, f(121) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.\nAs the number N is very big, it is given in the following run length encoded format - N is represented as a sequence of M blocks, where each block i (0 <= i < M) is represented by two integers - (len[i], d[i]). This implies that the digit d[i] occurs len[i] number of times.\nFor example, {(2,1), (1,2), (2,9)} represents the number 11299.\nCan you help them by writing a solution to validate the supercomputer's output?\nNote: There will be no leading zeros in the given number.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the first line contains an integer M.\nEach of the following M lines contain 2 space separated integers, where the ith line describes the ith block with length len[i] and digit d[i] respectively.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the result modulo 1000000007 on a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 25\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\nd[0] > 0\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 d[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 9\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 len[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Total length of N \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1\n1 5\n2\n1 1\n1 0\n\nOutput:\n15\n46\n\n\nExplanation\nFor case 1, the N is 5 and the result is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.\nFor case 2, the N is 10 and the result is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + (1 + 0) = 46.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 acm-icpc, acmamr14, admin, dynamic-programming, medium-hard\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-10-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n10 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

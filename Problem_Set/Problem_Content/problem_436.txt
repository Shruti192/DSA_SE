b'\nA DNA sequence can be represented by a string of letters T, A, C, and G representing four different amino acids. DNA sequences are often matched to infer structural or functional similarities between living beings. Given two DNA sequences X and Y, the sequence Y is said to be contained in X if Y can be obtained from X by deleting 0 or more letters (not necessarily consecutive) in X. \nGiven two DNA sequences X and Y, what can be the minimum length of a third sequence Z such that both X and Y are contained in Z?\nInput\nThe first line contains the number of test cases N (0 < N \xe2\x89\xa4 3). For each test case, the first line contains two integers P and Q (0 < P, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 1000) denoting the number of letters in the two sequences X and Y respectively. The second line contains the sequence X and the third line contains the sequence Y.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by a single integer indicating the minimum length of sequence Z.\nSample Input\n2\n7 6\nTAGCTAG\nATCATG\n10 9\nGGATGCTACA\nTCTACCGTA\n\nSample Output\nCase 1: 9\nCase 2: 13\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KGP14B\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 admin3, dynamic-programming, easy-medium, kgp14ros\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-12-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian  and Vietnamese as well.\nNazik gave Batman a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). There are some robbers in the tree; of course, Batman wants to catch the robbers.\nInitially, Batman is in a vertex ss and his power is equal to pp. During each of the next MM seconds, the following process happens:\n\nA robber with power rr runs from a vertex xx straight to vertex yy.\nBatman either catches the robber or stays in his current vertex (and never catches this robber).\nBatman can only catch the robber if Batman's power is strictly greater than the robber's power.\nLet's denote Batman's current vertex by ss (s=sis=si initially). To catch the robber, Batman must choose a vertex gg such that each vertex on the simple path between xx and yy (inclusive) lies also on the simple path between ss and gg (inclusive). If it is impossible to choose a vertex gg so that this condition is satisfied, Batman cannot catch this robber.\nIf Batman catches the robber, gg becomes his current vertex.\nAfter Batman catches this robber, his power increases by tt.\n\nYour task is to calculate the maximum power Batman can have after MM seconds if he chooses the robbers to catch optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, sisi and pp.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting an edge in the tree between vertices uu and vv.\nThe next line contains a single integer MM.\nEach of the following MM lines contains four integers xx, yy, rr and tt describing a robber.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible value of Batman's power after MM seconds.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4si,u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4si,u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nx\xe2\x89\xa0yx\xe2\x89\xa0y\n1\xe2\x89\xa4p,r\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4p,r\xe2\x89\xa4109\n|t|\xe2\x89\xa4109|t|\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of NN for all test cases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x851054\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of MM for all test cases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x851054\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6 1 4\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5\n1 6\n5\n6 4 3 8\n1 2 3 2\n4 6 5 -1\n6 5 4 6\n5 4 5 -3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nIn the 2-nd second, Batman will go from vertex s=1s=1 to vertex g=5g=5.\nIn the 4-th second, Batman will go from vertex s=5s=5 to vertex g=6g=6.\nBatman should ignore robbers moving in the 1-st, 3-rd and 5-th second.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85barenuz\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BTMNTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Lazy Propagation, DP on Trees, Euler Tour\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Segment Trees, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2973\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-06-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

Your task is to calculate the expected value of the number of vertices having exactly one child in such tree assuming that it is uniformly chosen from the set of all ordered trees of size N. \nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \nEach testcase contains a single integer N for which you should calculate the answer.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing two integers, which are explained below.\nConsider the answer to be a proper fraction P/Q, where gcd(P, Q) = 1. Then your task is to output two integers PQ-1 mod 109+7 and PQ-1 mod 109+9.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nIt is guaranteed that Q will be invertible with respect to both the modulos.\n\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\n\nSubtask #3 (30 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\nSubtask #4 (40 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0 0\n1 1\n1 1\n400000004 200000003\n\n\nExplanation\nYou can see every possible tree with 1, 2, 3 or 4 vertices on the diagram below.\n\n\n\nFrom this you can see that answers for these inputs are 0/1 = 0, 1/1 = 1, (2+0)/2 = 1 and (3+1+1+1+0)/5 = 6/5 correspondingly.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85melfice\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EXPTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Number Theory, Expected Value, Catalan Numbers, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Mathematics, Probability, Combinatorics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2081\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-06-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

Our little Chef Chang liked this way of defining the beauty of a sequence and henceforth, came up with the following puzzle.\n\nFind out how many sequences of non-negative integers of length N exist such that the sum of beauty values of all their subsequences modulo 109 + 7 equals a given integer B. Each element in the sequence should be strictly less than a given integer C (fixed to 220).\nSince, the number of such sequences can be large, output this number modulo 109 + 7.\n\n\nHelp the people of BitLand to solve this puzzle.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case contains three space separated N, B and C as mentioned in the statement.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output an integer corresponding to the answer to the test case in a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 B \xe2\x89\xa4 109 + 6\nC = 220\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 0 1\n2 3 2\n2 2922 1024\nOutput:\n1\n2\n616\n\nExplanation\nExample 1. Only possible sequence will be 0 0. Its beauty value will be zero.\nExample 2.The subsequences with beauty equal to 3 will be 0 1 and 1 0. So, the answer is 2.\nExample 3. There are 616 sequences in total that have length 2 and each integer is less than 1024 such that sum of the beauty values of their subsequences modulo 109 + 7 is 2922.\nNote\nPlease note that the above three examples don't have C = 220. These examples are just for making sure that you understand the problem correctly. In the test data it will be guaranteed that C is indeed 220. \n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n2 345 1048576\n\nOutput:\n100\nExplanation\n\nThere are 100 sequences in total that have length 2 and each integer is less than 1048576 such that sum of the beauty values of their subsequences modulo 109 + 7 is 345.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85prateekg603\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHNGSEQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bit Manipulation, Bitwise Operation, Meet in the middle\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-06-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

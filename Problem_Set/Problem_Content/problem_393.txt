b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef loves brackets. So much so, that rather than just use plain brackets like (), {}, or [], he has invented his own notation that allows him to use many more types of brackets.\nEach type of bracket is designated by an integer. A negative integer -x represents an opening bracket of type x; while a positive integer x represents a closing bracket of type x. Any sequence of such integers is then called a bracket-pair sequence.\nA balanced bracket-pair sequence can be defined recursively as follows:\n\nThe empty sequence is a balanced bracket-pair sequence.\nIf S is a balanced bracket-pair sequence, then -x S x is a balanced bracket-pair sequence for any positive integer x.\n\tIf S and T are balanced bracket-pair sequences, then S T is a balanced bracket-pair sequence.\n\n\nFor example, "-1 -2 2 -3 -4 4 3 1" is a balanced bracket-pair sequence, but "-1 -2 1 2" is not.\nChef has a bracket-pair sequence (which may or may not be balanced) consisting of N integers. There are 2N ways to form a subsequence of his sequence. He wants to know how many of these subsequences are balanced.\nHelp him to calculate this number, modulo 109+7. \nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer N denoting the number of brackets in his sequence. \nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the types of brackets. A negative number means an opening bracket; a positive number means a closing bracket.\nOutput\nIn a single line print the required answer.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n-109 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109Ai \xe2\x89\xa0  0\nIt is not guaranteed that each opening bracket has a closing bracket of same type and vice-versa. \n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask N \xe2\x89\xa4 10 Points: 10 \nSubtask N \xe2\x89\xa4 20 Points: 15 \nSubtask N \xe2\x89\xa4 100 Points: 75 \n\n \nExample\nInput:\n11\n-1 -2 9 2 -3 -4 3 4 8 8 1 \n\nOutput:\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85xiaodao\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFBR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modular Arithmetic\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2207\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-03-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

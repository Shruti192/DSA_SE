b"\nRead problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a multi-set S of N integers, and an integer K. You want to find the maximum value of minimal excluded non-negative integer (MEX) of the multi-set given that you are allowed to add at most any K integers to the multi-set. Find the maximum value of MEX that you can obtain. \nFew examples of finding MEX of a multi-set are as follows. MEX of multi-set {0} is 1, {1} is 0, {0, 1, 3} is 2, {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6} is 4.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space seperated integers N and K denoting the size of the multi-set and the maximum number of extra integers that you can add in the multi-set respectively.\nThe second line contains N space separated integers denoting the multi-set S: S1, S2 ,.... SN.\n\nOutput\nFor each testcase, output the answer in a single line. \nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Si \xe2\x89\xa4 2 * 105\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (15 points): K=0.\nSubtask #2 (85 points): Original Constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3 0\n1 0 2\n3 1\n1 0 2\n4 3\n2 5 4 9\n2 0\n3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n6\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. As K = 0, so we can't add any element to the multi-set. Elements of the set are {1, 0, 2}. The MEX value of this set is 3.\nExample case 2. As K = 1, you are allowed to add at most 1 element to the multi-set. The multi-set are {1, 0, 2}. You can add element 3 to the multi-set, and it becomes {1, 0, 2, 3}. The MEX value of this multi-set is 4. There is no other way to have higher value of MEX of the set by adding at most one element to the multi-set.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85hruday968\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alex_2oo8\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MEX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Greedy, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1478\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-08-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nSatkkeerthi has decided to participate in the Game of Stones. There are nn cities numbered 11 to nn and mm directeddirected\nroadsroads between the cities. \nThere is an infinitely large pile of stones in each city, of one particular colour. Each colour is described by a colour code, ai at the ith city.  \nA player must choose a path starting from one city, and at every city along the path, he/she adds one stone to the collection at hand. The score of a player is defined as the maximum number of stones collected of aa particularparticular colourcolour. Help Satkkeerthi maximize his score and be declared the bearer of an aptronym!\nInput:\nThe first line of input contains two integers nn,mm,the number of cities and the number of roads connecting them, respectively.\nThe second line contains nn integers separated by a space, ai denoting the colourcolour codecode of the stone at city i.\nThen mm lines follow, where each line contains two integers xx and yy, indicating that there is a directeddirected road from city xx to city yy. We remind you that xx and yy may be equal, and do notnot guarantee complete connectivity of all cities.\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer, the maximum score which Satkkerthi can achieve. If his score can be arbitrarily large, print -1.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4colourcode\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4colourcode\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\nSample input:\n 5 6\n 1 2 1 2 2\n 1 2\n 1 3\n 1 4\n 2 3\n 4 5\n 5 2\n\nSample Output:\n   3\n\nExplanation:\nThe path 4----2-----5 contains 3 stones of colour 2 and is thus the maximum score that can be obtained.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85bluishgreen\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 bluishgreen, depth-first-search, dynamic-programming, graphs, jp2018, medium, topological-sort\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-06-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

Each row is NN bricks long, all bricks have the same size and there are no holes.\nUnfortunately, the path looks pretty boring because all bricks have the same color. In order to make it more interesting, Chef wants to replace exactly KK bricks by more beautiful ones in such a way that no two replaced bricks share a side.\nChef asks you to answer a question that is too complicated for him: in how many ways can Chef select the bricks to replace? Since the answer can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of ways to replace bricks, modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n\nSubtasks:\nSubtask #1 (25 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000 \nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are exactly 88 valid ways to choose the positions of K=2K=2 beautiful bricks.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85neutron_byte\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BBRICKS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Pre processing, Permutations & Combinations, Recurrence Relation\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Combinatorics, Algorithms, Recursion\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2179\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-09-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

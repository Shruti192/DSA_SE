b"\nInitially, Alice and Bob both have a bag of NN stones each with every stone having a lowercase alphabet written on it. Both players know the stones of the other player.\nAlice and Bob want to create a string SS of length 2\xe2\x8b\x85N2\xe2\x8b\x85N using the stones they have. They play a game to create the string. The rules of the game are as follows:\n\nInitially, all the indices of SS are empty.\nAlice starts the game. The players take alternating turns. In each turn, the player can choose one of the stones from their bag and place it at any empty index ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85N) of SS. \nThe game ends when both the players have used all their stones.   \nAlice wants SS to be as lexicographically small as possible while Bob wants SS to be as lexicographically large as possible.\n\nFind the final string SS formed by characters written on stones if both Alice and Bob play optimally!  \nNote: A string XX is lexicographically smaller than a string YY if and only if one of the following holds:\n\nXX is a prefix of YY and X\xe2\x89\xa0YX\xe2\x89\xa0Y\nIn the first position where XX and YY differ, the string XX has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in YY.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT - the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows:\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN - the number of stones each player has.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string AA of length NN describing the stones in Alice's bag initially.\nThe third line of each test case contains a string BB of length NN describing the stones in Bob's bag initially.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print the final string SS formed if Alice and Bob play optimally.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\naza\nabz\n4\ncccc\ncccc\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nazabza\ncccccccc\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case-1: Initially Alice's stones are aza , while Bob's stones are abz.

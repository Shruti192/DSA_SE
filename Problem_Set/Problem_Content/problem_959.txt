b'\nAlice has a bucket of water initially having WW litres of water in it. The maximum capacity of the bucket is XX liters.\nAlice turned on the tap and the water starts flowing into the bucket at a rate of YY litres/hour. She left the tap running for exactly ZZ hours. Determine whether the bucket has been overflown, filled exactly, or is still left unfilled.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line of input containing four space-separated integers W,\xc2\xa0X,\xc2\xa0Y,\xc2\xa0ZW,\xc2\xa0X,\xc2\xa0Y,\xc2\xa0Z.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print the answer on a new line:\n\nIf the bucket has overflown print overflow\nIf it is exactly filled print filled\nIf it is still unfilled, print unfilled\n\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings filled, FIlled, fiLLed, and FILLED will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4W,X,Y,Z\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4W,X,Y,Z\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (100 points):\nOriginal constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1 2 3 4 \n10 70 10 6 \n2 100 4 3\n4 3 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\noverFlow\nfilled\nUnfilled\noverflow\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: Initially the bucket had 11 litre of water, we then added 33 litres of water for 44 hours. Thus, the total bucket inflow was 1+3\xc3\x974=131+3\xc3\x974=13 litres. Since this is greater than the capacity of 22 litres, the bucket will OVERFLOW\nTest case 22: Initially the bucket had 1010 litres of water, we then added 1010 litres of water for 66 hours. Thus, the total bucket inflow was 10+10\xc3\x976=7010+10\xc3\x976=70 litres. Since this is equal to the capacity of 7070 litres, the bucket will be FILLED\nTest case 33: Initially the bucket had 22 litres of water, we then added 44 litres of water for 33 hours. Thus, the total bucket inflow was 2+4\xc3\x973=142+4\xc3\x973=14 litres. Since this is lesser than the capacity of 100100 litres, the bucket will be UNFILLED.\nTest case 44: Initially the bucket had 44 litres of water, we then added 22 litres of water for 11 hours. Thus, the total bucket inflow was 4+2\xc3\x971=64+2\xc3\x971=6 litres. Since this is more than the capacity of 33 litres, the bucket will OVERFLOW.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nmradul_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WATERFLOW\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n483\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

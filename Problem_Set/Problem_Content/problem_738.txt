b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nSome cooking competitions going on to be held in various cities and the Chef wants to participate in them. There are NN cities numbered from 11 to NN and they are connected by N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 roads such that every city is connected to every other city. But traveling is a bit different here. Every city ii is assigned a travel value, AiAi. From a city numbered XX, one can only travel to another city YY such that the simple path from XX to YY has exactly AXAX roads.\nTo participate in a city's competition, the Chef just has to visit it. Help the Chef by finding the maximum number of competitions he can participate in if he can start from any city and visit any city multiple times.\nFormally, given a tree in which every node ii is assigned a value AiAi, you have to find the maximum number of distinct nodes that can be visited, if we can start from any node and visit any node multiple times. The only condition is that you can only move from node ii to jj if the number of edges between ii and jj is exactly AiAi.\nNote: Usually, there is no bound on the stack memory, and is equal to the total memory limit of 1.5 GB. But due to a system configuration issue, the stack limit for C++ is temporarily set to 8MB. So, if you believe that your code requires larger stack limit, please include this in your code.\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer TT, the number of test cases.

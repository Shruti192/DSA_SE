b"\nRam plays a strange number game. There are NN blocks numbered from  11  to NN.\nAt the beginning of game ram is at  NNth block and he wants to come at  11st block to win the game in minimum number of moves.\nIn one move, he can perform one of the following operations\n\nIf the number is power of two then divide it by  22  and that becomes the new position of Ram\nIf not then reduce it by the next lower number which is power of  22  which is Ram's new position\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains an integer NN (initial position of Ram).\n\nOutput:\nFor Each test case print a single line minimum number of moves.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4 264 - 11\n\nSample Input:\n4\n1\n2\n3\n6\n\nSample Output:\n0\n1\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nthe_rtu_coders\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BINPOWER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 bit-manipulation, cbiz2020, easy, math, the_rtu_coders\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\nGotham City is the home of Batman, and Batman likes to keep his people together. \nThere are NN houses in the city. The resident of the ithith house is of type AiAi. It is known that people of the same type are friends and people of different types are not friends. \nTo maintain peace, Batman can do the following type of operation:\n\nChoose indices ii and jj (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N) and reverse the substring A[i,j]A[i,j]. \n\nDetermine the length of the longest range of friends after applying at most kk operations on the string for all 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4N0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4N.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN, the number of houses in Gotham city.\nThe next line contains a string AA with NN characters. The ithith character denotes the type of the ithith person.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single line, (N+1)(N+1) space-separated integers where the ithith integer signifies the length of the longest range of friends after applying  at most ii operations.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.\nString AA contains lowercase English alphabets only.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\naaaa\n4\nabca\n7\nbabbaab\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 4 4 4 4\n1 2 2 2 2\n2 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: All 44 people are friends. Thus, the answer is 44 for all values of kk.\nTest case 22: \n\nFor k=0k=0, the length of the longest range of friends is 11.\nFor k=1k=1, we can choose i=1i=1 and j=3j=3. On reversing the substring [1,3][1,3], we get cbaa. Thus, length of longest range of friends is 22.\nFor k=2,3,k=2,3, and 44, the length of the longest range of friends is 22 as no more people of the same type can be grouped together.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85bwayne\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CRZYSUBSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arrays, Mathematics, Dynamic Programming, Hashing\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2126\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-04-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\n"I hide in plain sight, just as you".\nGus Fring has earned a huge profit from Los Pollos Hermanos and he wishes to celebrate. He loves watching horse-riding, hence he bought NN horses.\nOne day he organizes a horse-riding competition to celebrate the deal with Don Eladio.\nThere are NN horses taking part in the competition with speeds of AA11,, AA22,, ...,..., AANN respectively. It is given that all speeds are distinct.\nMultiple races are being conducted and it is not mandatory for each horse to participate in every race.\nFor the iithth horse, find the number of subsets with size \xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x89\xa5 22 such that if a race were to be conducted between horses in this subset then the iithth horse would finish in the top three.\nFor subsets of size 2 the runner should finish either 1st or 2nd. There is no 3rd position when the size of the subset is 2.\nSince the answer might be quite large, compute it, modulo 10000000071000000007 (109+7)(109+7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nFirst line of each testcase contains of a single integer NN denoting the number of horses.\nThe second line of each testcase contains NN space-separated integers AA11,, AA22,, ...,...,AANN, denoting the speeds of the horses. \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output a single line containing NN space separated integers , where the iithth integer denotes the number of subsets of size \xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x89\xa5 22 modulo (109+7)(109+7), such that the iithth horse finishes in the top three.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\nAll speeds are distinct\nSum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x88\x971055\xe2\x88\x97105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n    1\n    4\n    4 2 3 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n    7 7 7 6\n\n\nExplanation\nFor the 1st horse the 7 subsets are-  [4,2,3,1],[4,2,3],[4,2,1],[4,3,1],[4,2],[4,1],[4,3][4,2,3,1],[4,2,3],[4,2,1],[4,3,1],[4,2],[4,1],[4,3]\nFor the 2nd horse the subsets are-  [4,2,3,1],[4,2,3],[4,2,1],[2,3,1],[2,4],[2,1],[2,3][4,2,3,1],[4,2,3],[4,2,1],[2,3,1],[2,4],[2,1],[2,3] \n For the 3rd horse the subsets are-  [4,2,3,1],[4,2,3],[3,2,1],[4,3,1],[3,2],[3,1],[4,3][4,2,3,1],[4,2,3],[3,2,1],[4,3,1],[3,2],[3,1],[4,3] \n For the 4th horse the subsets are-  [1,2,3],[4,2,1],[4,3,1],[1,2],[4,1],[1,3][1,2,3],[4,2,1],[4,3,1],[1,2],[4,1],[1,3]\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85nishitsharma03\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RRUN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Permutations & Combinations, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Mathematics, Combinatorics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2187\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

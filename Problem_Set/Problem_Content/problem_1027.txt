b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nThis is an interactive problem.\nChef has a secret integer. The only information you have is that it has an odd number of factors and that it lies between 11 and 106106 inclusive.\nYou have been challenged by Chef to find his number. You may make up to 2,0002,000 guesses (queries). Whenever you guess Chef's number, he only tells you if you guessed correctly or not. Can you find Chef's number?\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you should read a line containing a single integer TT \xe2\x80\x95 the number of test cases. The description of interaction for TT test cases follows.\nFor each test case, you should start by asking queries.\nTo ask a query, you should print a line containing an integer between 11 and 106106 inclusive \xe2\x80\x95 your guess.\nThen, you should read a line containing a single integer: 11 if you correctly guessed Chef's secret number, 00 if your guess was incorrect or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if your guess is invalid (in particular, smaller than 11 or greater than 106106) or you have asked more than 2,0002,000 queries.\nAs soon as you have correctly guessed Chef's secret number, you should stop asking queries and continue solving the remaining test cases.\n\nIf you read \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921, you must immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

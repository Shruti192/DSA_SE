Here are the rules of soccer for dogs:\n\nNN dogs (numbered 11 through NN) stand in a line in such a way that for each valid ii, dogs ii and i+1i+1 are adjacent.\nEach dog has a skill level, which is either 11 or 22.\nAt the beginning of the game, Chef passes a ball to dog 11 (dog 11 receives the ball).\nFor each valid ii, if dog ii has skill level ss, this dog can pass the ball to any dog with number jj such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4|i\xe2\x88\x92j|\xe2\x89\xa4s1\xe2\x89\xa4|i\xe2\x88\x92j|\xe2\x89\xa4s.\nEach dog (including dog 11) may receive the ball at most once.\nWhenever a dog receives the ball, it must either pass it to another dog or finish the game by scoring a goal.\n\nWhile the dogs were playing, Chef also created a game for developers. He defined the result of a game of soccer for dogs as the sequence of dogs which received the ball in the order in which they received it. The last dog in the sequence is the dog that decided to score a goal; if a dog never received the ball, it does not appear in the sequence. In the game for developers, you should find the number of possible results of soccer for dogs.\nFind this number of possible results modulo 109+7109+7. Two results of soccer for dogs (sequences of dogs' numbers) are considered different if these sequences have different lengths or if there is a valid index ii such that the ii-th dog in one sequence is different from the ii-th dog in the other sequence.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN denoting the skill levels of the dogs.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of different results of soccer for dogs, modulo 109+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa421\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa42 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa410N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (30 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4103N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n1 1 1 1\n3\n2 2 2\n4\n1 2 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n5\n6\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The following results are possible: 11, [1,2][1,2], [1,2,3][1,2,3], [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4].\nExample case 2: The following results are possible: [1][1], [1,2][1,2], [1,2,3][1,2,3], [1,3,2][1,3,2], [1,3][1,3].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFSOC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 berezin, dynamic-programming, easy-medium, march19, pattern, taran_1407\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2436\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-04-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

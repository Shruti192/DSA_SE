b"\nRam has recently won a lottery of 1 billion Simalokolan-Dollars.\nAnd he has bought a huge mansion with half of the lottery amount.   \nNow he has hired NN maids (numbered from 11 to NN) to take care of the mansion! \nEach maid has her report card from National Housekeeper Examination!\nThe report card of each maid has 3 different fields - Vacuuming skills , Laundry skills and Dish-washing skills.\nEach maid has got a score for each of the different skills; \nRam will assign each maid only one type of task i.e Vacuuming or Laundry or Dish-washing.\nNo maid shall do more than one type of task.\nAlso, Ram got to know that for each i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N\xe2\x88\x921]i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N\xe2\x88\x921],  ithith maid is friend of (i+1)th(i+1)th maid.\nRam also knows that if he assign both ithith and (i+1)th(i+1)th maid the same type of task then they will gossip all day and not work properly.\nSo Ram won't assign them same type of task i.e tasks given to ithith and (i+1)th(i+1)th maid shall not be same.\nLet Assigned score of the ithith maid be equal to the score on her report card for the type of task she's assigned.\nNow Ram wonders what is the maximum total assigned score he can get.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nThe first line of each testcase contains an integer NN denoting the number of maids.\nThe second line contains NN space separated integers where the ithith integer denotes the Vacuuming skills score of ithith maid.\nThe third line contains NN space separated integers where the ithith integer denotes the Laundry skills score of ithith maid.\nThe fourth line contains NN space separated integers where the ithith integer denotes the Dish-Washing skills score of ithith maid.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the maximum total assigned score Ram can get.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe Vacuuming skill score for each maid doesn't exceed 105105.\nThe Laundry skill score for each maid doesn't exceed 105105\nThe Dish-Washing skill score for each maid doesn't exceed 105105\nSum of NN over all test cases doesn't exceed 105105\n\n\nSample Input:\n1\n3\n3 2 1\n2 3 1\n1 2 3 \n\nSample Output:\n9\n\nEXPLANATION:\nRam can assign Vacuuming to 1st maid and Laundry to 2nd maid and Dish-washing to 3rd maid.\nThis assignment will give a total score of 3+3+3=9 score.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85pritishn\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RAM_SAMA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, ftcf2020, pritishn, pritishn\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

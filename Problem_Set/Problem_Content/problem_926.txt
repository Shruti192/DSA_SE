You are given TSTS and your task is to find the number of possible values of JSJS such that Jerry wins the following game.\nThe game consists of one or more turns. In each turn:\n\nIf both TSTS and JSJS are even, their values get divided by 22 and the game proceeds with the next turn.\nIf both TSTS and JSJS are odd, a tie is declared and the game ends.\nIf TSTS is even and JSJS is odd, Tom wins the game.\nIf TSTS is odd and JSJS is even, Jerry wins the game.\n\nFind the number of possible initial values of JSJS such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4JS\xe2\x89\xa4TS1\xe2\x89\xa4JS\xe2\x89\xa4TS, there is no tie and Jerry wins the game.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer TSTS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of values of JSJS such that Jerry wins the game.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4TS\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4TS\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): T,TS\xe2\x89\xa4100T,TS\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n11\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We must have JS=TS=1JS=TS=1, but in this case, the game ends and a tie is declared in the first turn.\nExample case 2: If JS\xe2\x88\x88{2,4,6,8,10}JS\xe2\x88\x88{2,4,6,8,10}, then JSJS is even and TSTS is odd, so Jerry wins the game in the first turn. Any odd value of JSJS leads to a tie instead.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85sahi1422\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EOEO\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1337\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

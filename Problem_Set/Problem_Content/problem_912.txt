b'\nThe samosa wala bhaiya had rolled some dough to make his special samosa and to make up to create NN samosa, each of which is a rectangle because our samosa wala bhaiya is very creative. He was just about to put them in the hot oil tawa when he remembered that the crispy edges of samosa taste particularly delicious.Since our Samosa wala bhaiya is also a lover of Geometry so, he thinks he would be happiest if the sum of the perimeters of all the samosa were as close as possible to PP centimetres(cm), without going over. (If the batch of Samosa is too edgy, it might burn!)\nFor each Samosa, Samosa wala Bhaiya can decide whether to leave it as is, or make a single straight cut to separate it into two (not necessarily rectangular) halves with equal area. (Note that such a cut must necessarily go through the center of the Samosa.) The two new Samosa created in this way cannot themselves be cut again.\nIf Samosa wala bhaiya makes optimal decisions, what is the closest he can come to PP without exceeding it?\nInput:\nThe first line contains one positive integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.\nEach begins with one line with two integers 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100.and PP: the number of Samosa, and the desired perimeter sum (in mm), respectively. Then, NN lines follow. The i-th of these has two integers 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Wi \xe2\x89\xa4 250, and 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Hi \xe2\x89\xa4 250: the width and height (both in mm) of the i-th Samosa.\nNoteNote:P \xe2\x89\xa5 2 \xc3\x97 the sum of (Wi + Hi) over all i. (P is at least as large as the sum of the perimeters of all Samosa before any cuts are made.). Also, P \xe2\x89\xa4 108.\nOutput:\nthe largest possible sum (in mm) of the perimeters of all Samosa(after Samosa wala bhaiya is done) that does not exceed PP.\nsample Input\n4\n1 7\n1 1\n2 920\n50 120\n50 120\n1 32\n7 4\n3 240\n10 20\n20 30\n30 10\nSample Output:\n6.828427\n920.000000\n32.000000\n240.000000\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85krish_murarka\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/REC_SAM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 crsh2020, dynamic-programming, hard, krish_murarka\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

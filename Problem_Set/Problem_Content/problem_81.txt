b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN cars (numbered 11 through NN) on a circular track with length NN. For each ii (2\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N2\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the ii-th of them is at a distance i\xe2\x88\x921i\xe2\x88\x921 clockwise from car 11, i.e. car 11 needs to travel a distance i\xe2\x88\x921i\xe2\x88\x921 clockwise to reach car ii.\nFor each valid ii, you can fill the ii-th car's tank with up to fifi litres of gasoline, with cost cici coins per litre.\nAfter that, you choose some car, sit in this car and start driving in the clockwise direction. To move one unit of distance in this direction, you need to spend 11 litre of gasoline. When you pass another car (even if you'd run out of gasoline exactly at that point), you steal all its gasoline. You cannot move if you do not have any gasoline left.\nYour goal is to fill the cars in such a way that you are able to choose an optimal car, travel the clockwise distance NN and return to the place where you were initially. Under this constraint, you want to pay the least possible number of coins.\nFind the smallest number of coins you need to pay. It is guaranteed that there is a way to travel the distance NN. It can be proved that in such a case, the smallest number of coins is always an integer.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers f1,f2,\xe2\x80\xa6,fNf1,f2,\xe2\x80\xa6,fN.\nThe third line contains NN space-separated integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cNc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest possible number of coins you need to pay.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4fi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4fi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa42,000N\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n3\n3 0 0\n10 0 0\n3\n3 3 3\n3 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n30\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nildar_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GASOLINE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1995\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nA programming competition will be held in Chef's city which only accepts teams of size 22. At least one person in a team should know a programming language and at least one person should know about the English language. It is possible that one person in a team knows both programming and the English language. Then the qualification of the other teammate is not important i.e. he may or may not know programming and English. Now Chef has NN students and wants to send maximum number of teams to the competition.\nYou are given an integer NN and two binary strings SS and TT of length NN. Si=Si= '1' denotes that the ithith student knows a programming language, and Si=Si= '0' denotes otherwise; similarly, Ti=Ti= '1' denotes that the ithith student knows English language, and Ti=Ti= '0' denotes otherwise. Determine the maximum number of teams Chef can form.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer QQ denoting the number of test cases. The description of QQ test cases follows.\nEach test case contains 33 lines of input.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string SS.\nThe last line of each test case contains a string TT.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum number of teams that Chef can form.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSS and TT contains only characters '0' and '1'\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n101\n001\n4\n1010\n0110\n3\n000\n110\n2\n10\n11\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: The third student can team up with any other students as he knows both programming and English.\nTest case 22: The first two students make a team and the last two students make another team.\nTest case 33: No student knows how to program, hence there is no way to make a team.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TEAMFOR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Conditional Statements, Basic Maths, Greedy, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1715\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-08-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

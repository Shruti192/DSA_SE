b'\nMr. White wants to improve the quality of his methamphetamine among his consumers to boost his production. He has noticed that if he can increase the hardness(HH) and the fragrance (FF) of his product it will become more popular. The initial hardness is XX and fragrance is 0. He has two chemicals  labelled 11 and 22 to add in his formula in order to increase the HH and FF. \n\nAdding 11: HH gets multiplied by AA and FF is increased by 1.\nAdding 22: HH gets increased by BB and FF is increased by 1.\n\nThe quality of the methamphetamine will decrease if H\xe2\x89\xa5YH\xe2\x89\xa5Y. Find the maximum possible fragnance (FF) without lowering the quality of the drug.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains a single line of input, four integers X,Y,A,BX,Y,A,B. \n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line , the maximum possible FF of drug without lowering quality of the Drug.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa4109\n2\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n1\n\n4   20   2   10\nSample Output:\n2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nInitially Drug Hardness H was 4. Mr. White can make his fragrance F 2 by the following operation.\n\nHe can choose Chemical 1 and increase the hardness and fragrance of Drug to H 8 and F 1.\nAnd then he chooses Chemical 2 and increase the hardness and fragrance of Drug to H 18 and F 2.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no way he mix the chemicals so that the fragrance F becomes greater than 2.  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85nitishcs414\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRJOL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 brkc2020, easy, logic-maths, math, nitishcs414\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

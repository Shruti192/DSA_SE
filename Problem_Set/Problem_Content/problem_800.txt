b"\nThis is a story of city Chef Land. The transport network of the city contains V intersections and E bidirectional roads. The intersections are numbered from 1 to V. Every intersection can be reached from every other intersection. The road Ei has length Wi. The Mayor is organizing a Science Festival at intersection F.\nThe N students studying in School of Chef Land have requested their principal to send them to the Festival. Each student lives at an intersection (student i lives at intersection Pi). The school is present at intersection S.\nThe principle wants to send randomly some of the N students to the Science Festival. He writes their names on an Official List and gives it to the bus driver to arrange the transport. The probability that name of ith student is written on the list is equal to the percentage marks Mi he receives in Science.\nThe driver's job is to drive the school bus from school S to Festival F picking up all the students mentioned on the official list. Since all the students are super excited to visit the festival, therefore if the bus goes through the intersection they are living on, they will on board the bus even if their name was not written on the official list by the principal.\nWe know that the bus driver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like talkative people in the bus. Also, for every student i we know his talkativeness value Ti. The talkativeness of the trip done by driver from S to F is defined as the product of Talkativeness of all the students that got into the bus.\nFor a trip: The driver faces a cost(Trip) = Length(Trip) + (Talkativeness(Trip) modulo 109+7 ). Therefore the driver always chooses the path with minimum cost. He also charges this amount from the principal.\nIf the driver receives an empty list he cancels the trip and the cost is 0.\nThe principal wants to know the expected value of money paid by him to the driver for a single trip.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains 4 space separated integers V, E, S, F.\nThe second line contains a single integer N.\nith line of the next N lines contains 3 integers each Pi Ti\xc2\xa0 Mi.\nThe next E lines contains 3 integers each u v w denoting a road of length w between intersections u and v.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single integer (A*B-1) mod 109+7 where A/B is the expected money paid by the principal and gcd(A, B) = 1.\xc2\xa0B-1 is the modular inverse of B modulo 109+7\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 V \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 E \xe2\x89\xa4 3000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 16\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 S, F, Pi \xe2\x89\xa4 V\nS, F, Pi's are all distinct\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa0Mi \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ti \xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa0109+6\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 w \xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa0106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 V\nThere is at most 1 road between any pair of intersection\nEvery intersection can be reached from every other intersection.\nu \xe2\x89\xa0 v\n\nExample\nInput:\n5 5 1 5\n3\n2 1 50\n3 1 50\n4 1 50\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n1 4 1\n2 5 1\n3 5 1\n\nOutput:\n125000005\n\nExplanation\n\n\n\nOfficial List\nProbability\nPath travelled\nLength\nStudentsin trip\nTalkValue\nCost\n\n\n{}\n1/8\nNone\n0\nNone\n0\n0\n\n\n{2}\n1/8\n1-2-5\n2\n{2}\n1\n3\n\n\n{3}\n1/8\n1-3-5\n2\n{3}\n1\n3\n\n\n{4}\n1/8\n1-4-1-3-5\n4\n{3, 4}\n1*1\n5\n\n\n{2, 3}\n1/8\n1-2-1-3-5\n4\n{2, 3}\n1*1\n5\n\n\n{2, 4}\n1/8\n1-4-1-2-5\n4\n{2, 4}\n1*1\n5\n\n\n{3, 4}\n1/8\n1-4-1-3-5\n4\n{3, 4}\n1*1\n5\n\n\n{2, 3, 4}\n1/8\n1-4-1-2-1-3-5\n6\n{2, 3, 4}\n1*1*1\n7\n\n\n\nExpected cost =(0+3+3+5+5+5+5+7)/8 = 33/8 = 33 * 8-1 mod 109+7= 33*125000001\xc2\xa0 mod 109+7 = 125000005\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85usaxena95\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SCIENCEF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Bitmask, Travelling Salesman Type Problems, Bitmasking, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Advanced Graph Algos, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-12-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

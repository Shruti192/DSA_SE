b'\nThe rail system in Mumbai has changed. Now, you can buy a ticket from a station, and go to another station, if there are exactly K tracks on the route, and the route passes through a particular station. You are given N, the number of stations in Mumbai. The number M denotes how many tracks there are in the system. You are also given M pairs of integers, Ai and Bi, denoting that there is a track from Ai to Bi. Now, Dipen is from Jalgaon and hence, wants to know in how many ways, he can get from city X to city Z via city Y if he has a ticket that allows for exactly K tracks in all. Can you help him out?\nNote:Trains can run in only one direction on a track, from Ai to Bi.\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains T.  T testcases follow.\nThe first line of each testcase contain the integers N and M.\nM lines follow, containing Ai and Bi.\nThe last line of the testcase contains X, Y, Z and K.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output the required answer.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= T <= 100000\n1 <= N <=105\n1 <= M <= (N*(N+1))/2\n1 <=  Ai, Bi, X, Y, Z <= N\n1 <= K <= M\n1 <= Sum of N over all testcases <= 106\n\nExample:\nInput:\n2\n4 4\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n3 4\n1 3 4 2\n5 6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n4 3\n3 5\n1 3 5 3\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n\nExplanation:\nFor first testcase :\n\nDipen can go from 1 to 4 via 3 in exactly 2 tracks in 1 way.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85vedipen\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/VIACST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, graphs, kjcs16, vedipen\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b"\n\xc2\xa0\nFluffy the Squirrel has an m times n grid of lights, where some of them are turned on. He thinks a subrectangle of the grid is called beautiful if the number of lights that are on in the subrectangle is between l and r inclusive. He wonders how many beautiful subrectangles of the grid exist. Can you help him with this task?\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line of input contains two integers, m and n, denoting the number of rows and columns of the grid respectively. The next m rows contain n characters each, where each character is either '1', denoting a light which is on, or '0', denoting a light which is off. Finally, the last line contains two integers, l and r, which denotes the minimum and maximum number of on lights a beautiful subrectangle can have.\nOutput\nOutput a single integer, the number of beautiful subrectangles of the grid.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 40000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 l \xe2\x89\xa4 r \xe2\x89\xa4 m*n\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (12 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 m, n \xe2\x89\xa4 20\nSubtask 2 (30 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 30, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 200\nSubtask 3 (58 points) : Original Constraints\n\nExample\nInput:\n2 3\n100\n011\n2 3\n\nOutput:\n5\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

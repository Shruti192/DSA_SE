b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nIt's final exam week of Chef's cooking class. His class of N students are busy studying for it. Unfortunately, being crammers, each student is only able to study one topic. The i-th student studied topic Si. Topics are numbered 1 to 106.\nChef prepared N tasks for exam. He intends to assign each task to exactly one student. Each task requires exactly one topic to pass. The j-th task requires topic Tj.\nChef is a sadistic teacher, he doesn't want the students to pass! Therefore he wants to assign the tasks in such that the number of students assigned to the topic he/she studied for is minimized. Can you please help Chef in finding any such assignment?\nIf there are multiple possible assignments, you may output any one.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N. \nThe second line contains N space-separated integers S1, S2, ..., SN.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers T1, T2, ..., TN.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output two lines.\nThe first line should contain a single integer denoting the minimum number of students assigned to the topic he/she studied for, i.e. number of students who passed the exam. \nThe second line should describes assignment. It should contain N space separated integers - a1, a2, ..., aN, meaning the i-th student is assigned to the ai-th task.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 103\nThe sum of the Ns  in a single test file is \xe2\x89\xa4 3\xc3\x97105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Si \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Tj \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4\n100 200 300 400\n200 200 300 400\n3\n100 100 200\n100 100 200\n\nOutput:\n0\n2 3 4 1\n1\n2 3 1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Here, there exists an assignment where no student is assigned to the topic he/she studied for:\n\nStudent 1 gets task 2,\nStudent 2 gets task 3,\nStudent 3 gets task 4,\nStudent 4 gets task 1.\n\nExample case 2. In this test case, there's no way we can avoid at least one student from being assigned the topic he/she studied for. But the sample output shows that the minimum in this case is 1:\n\nStudent 1 gets task 2 (and thus gets the topic he/she studied for),\nStudent 2 gets task 3,\nStudent 3 gets task 1.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nTester:\n\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FAIRPAIR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-05-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

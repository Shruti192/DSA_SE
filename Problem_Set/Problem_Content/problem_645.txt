b'\nToday, you finally have a chance to compete with a famous coder like Chef and prove your mettle.\nChef has n distinct points in 2-D plane, i.e. there are never two points with both x and y coordinate equal and there are no two points with same x coordinate. Consider a subset of above n points which can be arranged as a sequence p1,..pk, such that xp1< xp2 < ...< xpk and each point pi, where i is in range between 3 and k (both inclusive) lies below or on the line passing between points pi-1 and pi-2. Chef likes these kind of subsets. So he wants to find the size of largest of such subsets. \nInput\nFirst line of the input contains one integer T - number of tests. T tests follows.\nFirst line of each test contains one integer N - number of points.\nThe next N lines of each test case contain integer point coordinates xi, yi.\nOutput\nFor a each test case, output a single integer in separate line corresponding to the largest subset size.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, N, sum over all N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 2000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 xi, yi \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nExample\n Input:\n 3\n 3\n 1 1\n 4 2\n 9 3\n 4\n 1 1\n 4 2\n 5 2\n 9 3\n 4\n 2 3\n 4 1\n 1 2\n 3 2\n\n Output:\n 3\n 3\n 4\n\nExplanation\nExplanation case 1. We can get sequence (1, 1) - (4, 2) - (9, 3), point (9, 3) lies below line between point (1, 1) and (4, 2).\nExplanation case 2. We can get (1, 1) -(4, 2) - (9, 3)\nExplanation case 3. We can get (1, 2) -(2, 3) - (3, 2) - (4, 1)\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/KOL16K\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Pre processing, Geometry, Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-12-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nKaneki and Touka love to play a game. The rules of the game are very simple. The players have \n\xe2\x80\x8bn\xe2\x80\x8bn cards in a row. Each card contains a number that is not necessarily distinct. The players take turns, Kaneki moves first. During his turn, a player can take a single card: either the leftmost card in a row or the rightmost one. The game ends when there are no more cards. The player who has the maximum sum of numbers on his cards by the end of the game wins. If both are having the same score by the end tie will be there, but Kaneki loves Touka so Touka will be declared as the winner.\nBoth players will play the game optimally.\nSaitama is a friend of Kaneki and Touka. He knows which strategy the guys are using, so he wants to determine the final score, given the initial state of the game. Help him.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nFirst line of the test case contains integer\xe2\x80\x8b nn, no of cards on the table\nThe second line of each test case contains nn space-separated  integers aiai, denoting the number on the cards from left to right \n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output the name of the winner \xe2\x80\x9cKaneki\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cKaneki\xe2\x80\x9d if Kaneki is winner \xe2\x80\x9cTouka\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cTouka\xe2\x80\x9d if Touka is the winner without quotes on newline.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample Input:\n3\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n5\n1 40 3 100 1\n4\n4 1 2 10\n\nSample Output:\nKaneki\nTouka\nKaneki\n\nEXPLANATION:\nHere in test case  1  \nKaneki will choose rightmost element 77 then remaining elements  are [1,2,3,4,5,6][1,2,3,4,5,6]\nTouka will choose  rightmost element 6 and so on this process will take place and the final score of kaneki will be 1616 and Touka\xe2\x80\x99s score will be 1212.\nHence KanekiKaneki is the winner.\nIn test case 2            \nIn this if case Kaneki chooses the leftmost element 1, now remaining elements are \n[40,3,100,1][40,3,100,1] . \nNow Touka will choose the leftmost element i.e. 40 \nremaining will be [3,100,1][3,100,1].\nNow Kaneki will choose leftmost then i.e. 3 remaining elements are [100,1][100,1] \nNow Touka will choose 100 \nFinally, Kaneki\xe2\x80\x99s score is 55 and Touka\xe2\x80\x99s score is 140140 there is a clear win for Touka.\nHence ToukaTouka is the winner.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85kaneki99\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PTEST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 c-plus-plus, cnst2020, dynamic-programming, kaneki99\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

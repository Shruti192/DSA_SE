b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nNobody outside the cooking community knows that Chef is a big fan of Chefgram\xe2\x84\xa2 \xe2\x80\x94 a social network where chefs and cooks upload their secret kitchen photos.\nRecently Chef clicked a beautiful photo, which is represented using 10 pixels in a single row. Respecting Chefgram\xe2\x84\xa2\'s boolean roots, every pixel is either white or black.\n\n\nChefgram\xe2\x84\xa2 has N filters. Every filter is a string containing 10 symbols. Every symbol is either \'+\' or \'-\'.\n\nA \'+\' at the ith position in a filter means that if Chef applies this filter to his photo, the ith pixel will be inverted: it becomes black if it was originally white, and vice versa. \nA \'-\' at the ith position in a filter string means that if Chef applies this filter to his photo, the ith pixel will remain unchanged.\n\n\n\nChef can apply as many filters as he wants from a list. He can pick any subset of filters and consequently apply them to a photo.\n\n\nFor example:\n\nImagine that Chef has a photo "bbwwbbwwbb" (where \'b\' stands for black and \'w\' stands for white).\nHe applies filters "++--++--++", "-+-+-+-+-+".\nApplying the first filter will transform his picture to "wwwwwwwwww". \nApplying the second filter on the transformed picture will give Chef the picture "wbwbwbwbwb".\n\n\n\nEven if Chefgram\xe2\x84\xa2 has two or more identical filters, they are still considered different!\n\n\nChef is extremely interested in knowing how many different subsets of all the Chefgram\xe2\x84\xa2 filters can he apply to transform his photo into 10 black pixels?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case contains a string S. Each symbol is either \'b\' or \'w\'. This is Chef\'s photo.\nSecond line of each test case contains a single integer N \xe2\x80\x94 the number of Chefgram\xe2\x84\xa2 filters.\nEach of the next N lines contains a single string Fi, each symbol of which is either \'+\' or \'-\'. This string is the ith Chefgram\xe2\x84\xa2 filter.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 answer to Chef\'s question modulo 109+7.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n|S| = 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n|Fi| = 10\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1: T \xe2\x89\xa4 5; N \xe2\x89\xa4 20; Points: 20\nSubtask 2: T \xe2\x89\xa4 5; N \xe2\x89\xa4 10^3; Points: 30\nSubtask 3: T \xe2\x89\xa4 5; N \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5; Points: 50\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\nwwwwwwwwww\n3\n+-+-+-+-+-\n----------\n+---------\nwbwbwbwbwb\n3\n+-+-+-+-+-\n+-+-------\n----+-+-+-\nbbbbbbbbbb\n2\n----------\n----------\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. There is no filter or combination of filters transforming the picture to whole black. \nExample case 2. Chef can either apply the first filter (and invert all whites) or apply the second and third filters in any order.\nExample case 3. Picture is already fully black, and we have two different identity filters. Chef can either apply the empty subset of filters, the first filter only, the second filter only, or both.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFFILT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, DP Bitmask, Bit Manipulation, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2039\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-10-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

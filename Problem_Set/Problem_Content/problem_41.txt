b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef likes to play games a lot. Gravity Guy is one such interesting game.\n"Gravity Guy is an arcade side-scrolling game in which the player controls Gravity Guy by tapping the screen to switch gravity. The objective in this game is to run as far as possible while avoiding being trapped by obstacles, falling, or flying off the screen. If hit by obstacles, the game is over."\nChef is so addicted to this game that each night he dreams of himself being in the game as Gravity Guy. He has two lanes in front of him represented by two strings of equal length named as L1 and L2. Each of the two lanes consists of some clean blocks represented by \'.\' and some dirty blocks represented by \'#\'.\nChef can start running from the beginning of any of the two lanes and cannot step over any dirty block ( \'#\' ) encountered during his journey. He has to complete his journey by reaching the end block of any of the two lanes.\nChef can use the following jumps to reach his destination. Considering chef is at xth block of some lane.\nHe can jump to x+1th block of the same lane.\nHe can switch gravity quickly and jump to xth block of the other lane.\nHe can switch gravity and jump to x+1th block of the other lane.\nYou have to tell him whether he can reach his destination or not. If it is possible for him to reach his destination, then Chef is interested in knowing the minimum number of gravity switches required to reach the destination.\nInput\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of 2 lines. First line of each test case contains a string denoting lane L1. Second line of each test case contains a string denoting lane L2.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line if Chef is able to reach the destination followed by a line containing an integer denoting minimum number of gravity switches required to reach to the destination. Print a single line containing the word "No" (without quotes) otherwise.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |L1| \xe2\x89\xa4 2 \xc3\x97 105, where |S| denotes the length of string S\n|L1| = |L2|\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (25 points)\nSum of |L1| over all test cases in one file it at most 200.\nOnly "Yes"/"No" response will be evaluated.\nSubtask 2 (25 points)\nSum of |L1| over all test cases in one file it at most 200.\nSubtask 3 (25 points)\nSum of |L1| over all test cases in one file it at most 106.\nOnly "Yes"/"No" response will be evaluated.\nSubtask 4 (25 points)\nSum of |L1| over all test cases in one file it at most 106.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n#...#\n.###.\n#.#.#.\n.#.#.#\n#...\n#...\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n2\nYes\n5\nNo\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: Chef will start his journey from L2L2. He switches gravity and jumps to L1L1. He continues on L1L1 till block 44 and then again switch gravity and jump to block 55 of L2L2. Therefore, he requires total 22 gravity switches to reach the destination.\nTest case 22: Chef will start his journey from L2L2. He switches gravity and jumps to second block of L1L1. He switches gravity and jumps to third block of L2L2. He switches gravity and jumps to fourth block of L1L1. He switches gravity and jumps to fifth block of L2L2. He switches gravity and jumps to sixth block of L1L1. Therefore, he requires total 55 gravity switches to reach the destination.\nTest case 33: Chef cannot start his journey as starting block of both the lanes L1L1 and L2L2 are dirty and he cannot step over them.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85ma5termind\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GRGUY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aug15, dynamic-programming, greedy, ma5termind, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1568\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-04-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

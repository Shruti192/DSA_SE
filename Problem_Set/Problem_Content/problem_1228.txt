b'\nThere are two teams (Team AA and Team BB) playing a tournament of NN matches of football against each other. Some of the matches are already completed and some are yet to be played. You are given a string SS of length NN representing the results of the NN matches for Team AA. The result of the ithith match can be represented by one of the following:\n\nW\xe2\x88\x92W\xe2\x88\x92 Team AA won the match. A win adds 33 points to the score of Team AA and 00 points to the score of Team BB\nD\xe2\x88\x92D\xe2\x88\x92 Team AA drew the match with Team BB. A draw adds 11 point to the score of both teams.\nL\xe2\x88\x92L\xe2\x88\x92 Team AA lost the match. A loss adds 00 points to the score of Team AA and 33 points to the score of Team BB\n?\xe2\x88\x92?\xe2\x88\x92 The match is yet to be played.\n\nAfter all the matches are played, the team with the highest score wins the tournament.\nTeam AA has hired a very experienced coach for the remaining matches. Now, because of the coach\'s training, the team can get any result they want (win/draw/lose) for the remaining matches. \nYour task is to tell the minimum number of remaining matches Team AA must win to make sure they win the tournament (i.e., the final score of Team AA must be strictly greater than the final score of Team BB).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then TT the test cases follow. \nFirst line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nSecond line of each test case contains a string SS of length NN.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line the minimum number of remaining matches Team AA must win. If it is not possible for Team AA to win the tournament output "-1".\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\nAll characters of the string consist of W,D,LW,D,L and ?? \n\nSample Input:\n3\n4\nLD?D\n4\n??LD\n3\nWWL  \nSample Output:\n-1\n2\n0  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85sibasish_14\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/THEGME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cakewalk, ftcf2020, math, sibasish_14, sibasish_14\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

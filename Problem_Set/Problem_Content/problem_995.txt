b"\nAlice has recently started playing Chess. Her current rating is XX. She noticed that when she wins a game, her rating increases by 88 points.\nCan you help Alice in finding out the minimum number of games she needs to win in order to make her rating greater than or equal to YY?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer TT \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers XX and YY, as described in the problem statement. \n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of games that Alice needs to win in order to make her rating greater than or equal to YY.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa4104\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n10 10\n10 17\n10 18\n10 19\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: Since Alice's current rating XX is already equal to her desired rating YY, she doesn't need to win any game. \nTest case 22: Alice's current rating is 1010. After winning 11 game, her rating will become 10+8=1810+8=18, which is greater than her desired rating of 1717. Thus, she has to win at least 11 game.\nTest case 33: Alice's current rating is 1010. After winning 11 game, her rating will become 10+8=1810+8=18, which is equal to her desired rating of 1818. Thus, she has to win at least 11 game. \nTest case 44: Alice's current rating is 1010. After winning 11 game, her rating will become 1818, which is less than her desired rating of 1919. She will need to win one more game in order to make her rating 2626, which is greater than 1919. Thus, she has to win at least 22 games.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nlavish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/C_RATING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n651\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-05-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

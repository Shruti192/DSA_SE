b'\nThe activity of a panipuri seller is "making a panipuri and putting it on the palte of his customer".    \nNN customers are eating panipuri, Given an array AA of length NN, ithith customer takes AiAi seconds to eat a panipuri.     \nThe Speed of Panipuri seller refers to the number of customers served per second. Determine the minimum speed of panipuri seller so that no customer has to wait for panipuri after getting his/her first panipuri.    \nAssume that the plate can hold infinite panipuris, and customer starts eating next panipuri just after finishing the current one.    You would be provided with the time taken by each customer to eat a panipuri.\nPanpuri seller serves panipuri in round robin manner (first to last and then again first).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the test cases follow.\nFor each test case, the first line contains NN number of customers.\nThen the second line will contain NN space separated integers, A1A1 to ANAN, eating time taken by each customer(in seconds).\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the minimum integral speed of panipuri seller so that no customer has to wait. \n\nConstraints\n\n0<T\xe2\x89\xa41000<T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n0<N\xe2\x89\xa41060<N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0<Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090<Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106\n\nSample Input:\n2\n4\n2 4 6 3\n5\n2 3 4 6 5\n\nSample Output:\n2\n\n3\nEXPLANATION:\nTestcaseTestcase 11:\n         Let\'s assume speed of panipuri seller be 1.\n       So starting from 0th0th second, in 00 to 11 second seller make a panipuri and put it into the plate of first customer, and first customer completely eat it in 11 to 33 second as he takes 22 second to eat a panipuri. But in 33 to 44 second panipuri seller is serving to 4th4th customer, and hence first customer have to wait, so 1 cannot be our answer.\n       Next possible speed can be 22 .\n       Starting from 0th0th second, at half second seller make a panipuri and put it into the plate of first customer,  first customer completely eat it on 2.52.5 second as he takes 22 second to eat a panipuri. In 0.50.5 to 11 second, seller serve the second customer. similarly in 11 to 22 second 3rd3rd and 4th4th customer will be serve, in 22 to 2.52.5 second, seller will again serve the first customer so at 2.52.5 sec 1st1st customer will have a panipuri to eat.\n       Similarly proceeding further we will find that no customer have to wait when speed is 22.  \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85gouravv\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ECPC10B\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, ecpg2020, gouravv, looping, math\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

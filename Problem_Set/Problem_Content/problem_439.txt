b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nStatement\nChef gives you a book with N pages. The pages are numbered from 1 to N.\nChef randomly selects a Secret Digit from 0 to 9. Now he asks you to open one page of the book without looking at the book. You win the game if that page number contains the Secret Digit. For example if the Secret Digit is 8, then 8, 80, 1238213, 98 are all winning pages and 9, 90, 1239123 are loosing pages.\nWhat is the probability of winning, if both Chef's choice and your choice has uniform distribution?\nInput\nThe first line of input contains integer T, denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a single line with integer N.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the required probability P/Q. P/Q is an irreducible fraction.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1017\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1\n5\n\nOutput:\n1/10\n1/10\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nChef can choose any Secret Digit from 0 to 9. But you can only open page with number 1. Probability that the Secret Digit is 1 after you opened the page with number 1 is 1/10.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anudeep2011\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ANUBGC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Digit DP, Probability, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2429\n\n\nDate Added:\n5-03-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

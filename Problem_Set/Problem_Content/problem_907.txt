b'\nChef and Chefina have decided to play the game of cubes and coins. There are NN cubes placed in a straight line numbered 11 through NN. The ii-th cube has a point PiPi associated with it. Each player takes alternate turns and proceeds as follows -\n\nIf only a single cube is left, player picks it. \nOtherwise, he/she tosses an unbiased coin. If the coin lands on heads, player takes the first cube otherwise they take the last cube.\n\nWhat is the expected total points Chef will get if he goes first?\nNote: The unbiased coin lands on heads with probability 0.5 (and hence lands on tails with the same probability). Also, the total point is the sum of points of all cubes that Chef will get.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. TT test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly 2 lines. \nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN, the number of cubes. \nThe second line contains NN space separated integers P1P1, P2P2, ......, PNPN, the points associated with cubes in the order they lie in a line.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput for each test case should contain a single real number in a separate line, the expected total points Chef will get for this particular test. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa49990\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa4999\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1\n100\n2\n42 0\n3\n1 4 9\n4\n5 5 5 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n100.000\n21.000\n9.500\n10.000\n\n\nExplanation\nCaseCase 1:1: In the first move Chef has to take 100100, and this is the only move. Hence, the expected points Chef will get is 100100.\nCaseCase 2:2: It is quite clear that Chef will make only 1 move. As he can get 4242 or 00 with equal probability, the expected points he will get is equal to 0.5\xe2\x88\x9742+0.5\xe2\x88\x970=210.5\xe2\x88\x9742+0.5\xe2\x88\x970=21.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85artha6391\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85anushka_nagar\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CMC302\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 artha6391, dynamic-programming, easy\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-10-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

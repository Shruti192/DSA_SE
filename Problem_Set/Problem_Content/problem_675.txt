For example, the sequence (3,3,2,1,3)(3,3,2,1,3) is good, since it contains 3\xe2\x89\xa452+13\xe2\x89\xa452+1 distinct elements, while the sequence (1,4,8,8,2)(1,4,8,8,2) is not good, since it contains 4>52+14>52+1 distinct elements.\nYou are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. You may perform any number of operations (including zero) on this sequence. In one operation, you should choose one element of the sequence and replace it by any integer you choose. You want all contiguous subsequences of the resulting sequence to be good. What is the smallest number of operations you need to perform to achieve this?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of operations needed to make all contiguous subsequences good.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4401\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa440\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 200200\nSubtask #2 (30 points): the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n6\n1 1 1 2 2 2\n4\n1 100 10000 1000000\n5\n1 2 3 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: All contiguous subsequences are already good.\nExample case 2: For example, (1,100,10000)(1,100,10000) is not good. It is enough to change the sequence to (1,100,100,1000000)(1,100,100,1000000), though.\nExample case 3: For example, (1,2,3)(1,2,3) is not good. It is enough to change the sequence to (1,2,1,2,1)(1,2,1,2,1).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85anton_trygub\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FEWDIFF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2853\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-09-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

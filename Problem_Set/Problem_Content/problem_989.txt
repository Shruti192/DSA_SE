To minimise the expenditure, Chef can pay for 22 items and get the third item for free. This way, the total money required is 4\xe2\x8b\x852=84\xe2\x8b\x852=8 rupees.\nTest Case 22: To minimise the expenditure, Chef can do the following:\n\nPurchase 22 items for 2\xe2\x8b\x852=42\xe2\x8b\x852=4 rupees and get the third one free. Thus, the total number of items is 33.\nPurchase 11 item for 2\xe2\x8b\x851=22\xe2\x8b\x851=2 rupees. Now Chef has total 44 items.\n\nThus, the minimum money required to buy 44 items is 4+2=64+2=6 rupees.\nTest Case 33: To minimise the expenditure, Chef can do the following:\n\nPurchase 22 items for 3\xe2\x8b\x852=63\xe2\x8b\x852=6 rupees and get the third one free. Thus, the total number of items is 33.\nPurchase 22 items for 3\xe2\x8b\x852=63\xe2\x8b\x852=6 rupees. Chef gets a third item for free. Now Chef has total 66 items which is greater than his requirement of 55 items. \n\nChef wanted to buy at least 55 items.

Thus, the total number of items is 33.\nPurchase 22 items for 1\xe2\x8b\x852=21\xe2\x8b\x852=2 rupees and get the third one free..

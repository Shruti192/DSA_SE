Chef is on a mission to spread a secret recipe of a Rogan Josh dish. Chef has a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AKA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AK and he must visit cities in the following way: he starts in the city A1A1, travels to the city A2A2, then travels from there to the city A3A3 and so on until he reaches the city AKAK. Note that a city may appear in AA multiple times, but Ai\xe2\x89\xa0Ai+1Ai\xe2\x89\xa0Ai+1 for each valid ii. When travelling between two cities, Chef always follows one of the shortest paths between them (but not necessarily the same one if he travels between them again).\nThe government is trying to track which cities are targeted by Chef. However, they do not know the sequence AA. Instead, they have tracked Chef's movement as a sequence B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BLB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BL of cities visited by Chef during his mission. Formally, B1=A1B1=A1 is the city where Chef starts, then for each valid ii, he moves from the city BiBi to the city Bi+1Bi+1 using the direct road between them and finally, he ends his mission in the city BL=AKBL=AK; Chef's sequence AA is a subsequence of BB, since the sequence BB also contains all shortest paths which Chef followed. It is guaranteed that there is a direct road between cities BiBi and Bi+1Bi+1 for each valid ii.\nHelp the government of Chefland find the minimum possible number of targeted cities, i.e. the minimum possible value of KK for a sequence AA that corresponds to the given sequence BB, or determine that no such sequence AA exists.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and LL.\nThe second line contains LL space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BLB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BL.\nEach of the following MM lines contains three space-separated integers uu, vv and ww describing a road between cities uu and vv with length ww.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum possible KK, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if a valid sequence AA does not exist.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)/21\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2\n2\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa410,0002\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nu\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v\n1\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa4106\nthere is at most one direct road between each pair of cities\nfor each valid ii, there is a direct road between cities BiBi and Bi+1Bi+1\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): w=1w=1\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 3 6\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 1 1\n4 4 9\n1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 1\n4 1 1\n3 3 2\n1 2\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n5\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SECRETMI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graphs, Greedy, Floyd Warshall's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Shortest Paths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2421\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-02-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b"\nRead problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nRyan is the president of a planet. There is a large bus station on this planet and MM buses stop at this station every day. For each valid ii, the ii-th bus arrives at the station titi seconds after midnight (on Ryan's planet, each day lasts 1010010100 hours, not 2424 hours), waits at the station for some non-negative (not necessarily integer) amount of time and then leaves.\nRyan knows that NN people are coming to the station today. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the ii-th person is described by parameters sisi, aiai, bibi, cici, didi with the following meaning:\n\nThis person arrives at the station sisi seconds after midnight with dissatisfaction 00.\nIf there is at least one bus that leaves the station strictly less than aiai seconds before this person arrives, their dissatisfaction increases by bibi.\nIf this person has to wait at the station for at least cici seconds before boarding a bus and leaving (this includes the time they spend waiting for a bus and the time spent waiting for that bus to leave), their dissatisfaction increases by didi.\n\nRyan may be the president, but his power is quite limited. He can tell each bus driver when to leave the station and each passenger when to board a bus (these times do not have to be integers). He also has to follow one rule: it is not allowed for two buses to be at the station at the same time.\nAs the president, his job is to make the citizens happy. Therefore, he is wondering about the minimum total dissatisfaction (the sum of final dissatisfactions of all NN passengers) he can achieve by using his power optimally. Of course, as an assistant to the president, you are the one who has to calculate that for him.\nNote that each passenger should board a bus at some point (during the day when they arrive at the station). Ryan does not want to leave someone hanging there for an eternity. Also, a passenger is allowed to board a bus at the moment when that bus is leaving (even if that passenger just arrived at the station at that moment).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases.

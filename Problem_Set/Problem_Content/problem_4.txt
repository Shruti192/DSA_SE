He wishes to sell all of them over NN years by selling exactly one car per year. For each valid ii, the initial price of the ii-th car is PiPi. Due to depreciation, the price of each car decreases by 11 unit per year until it is sold.\nNote that the price of a car cannot drop below 00 no matter how many years have passed, i.e. when the price of a car reaches 00 in some year, it remains 00 in all subsequent years.\nFind the maximum profit Chef can make if he sells his cars in an optimal way. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+7109+7).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum profit Chef can make, modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4251\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa425\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85103N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85103\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n6 6 6\n3\n0 1 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n15\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nDuring the first year, Chef's profit so far is 00 and the prices of the cars are [6,6,6][6,6,6]. Chef sells one of these cars.\nDuring the second year, Chef's profit so far is 66 and the prices of the remaining cars are [5,5][5,5]. Again, Chef sells one of these cars.\nDuring the third year, Chef's profit so far is 1111 and there is one car with price 44. Chef sells this car.\nIn the fourth year, Chef has sold all of his cars and his profit is 1515. This is the maximum profit he can make. \n\nExample case 2:\n\nDuring the first year, Chef's profit so far is 00 and the prices of the cars are [0,1,0][0,1,0]. Chef sells the second car.\nDuring the second year, Chef's profit so far is 11 and the prices of the remaining cars are [0,0][0,0]. Chef sells one of these cars.\nDuring the third year, Chef's profit so far is 11 and there is one car with price 00. Chef sells this car.\nDuring the fourth year, Chef has sold all his cars and his profit is 11.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85dragonado\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CARSELL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nJem couldn\'t even finish half of the homework exercises in "Advanced topics in algorithm" class. The teacher is really upset and gives him one final problem to solve - if he can\'t solve it, he is gonna fail the course.\n\n\nJem is given an array A consisting of N integers. The teacher asks him to remove exactly one number in the array to make the array become an arithmetic progressions.\n\nJem wanted to ask the teacher about the definition of arithmetic progressions but he remembered that he had heard this term in last week\'s lesson just before falling asleep. Now his life is in your hands again!\n\n\nAnyways, we provide you the definition of arithmetic progression. Arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers, where the difference between any two adjacent numbers is same.\n\nInput\nInput contains mutilpe test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer T represents the number of tests. It is followed by T group of line represent the test cases.\nEach test case consists of two lines where the first line contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space separated integers denoting the array A.\nOutput\nFor each test case print out single integer which is the number you will remove from the array. If there is more than one solution take the smallest one. If there is no solution print out -1.\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10 \n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n3 4\n4\n1 5 3 4\n6\n2 4 6 7 8 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n-1\n7\n\n\nExplanation\n\ntest 1: an array contain a single integer is considered to be an arithmetic progression so you can remove any number in the array. But note that we must print out the smallest result which is 3.\n\n\ntest 2: there is no solution since none of [1, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3], [1, 5, 4], [5, 3, 4] is an arithmetic progressions.\n\n\ntest 3: the only way to archive an airthmetic progressions is remove the number 7 which will give us [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntuan_adm\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85errichto\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TAASEQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2012\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

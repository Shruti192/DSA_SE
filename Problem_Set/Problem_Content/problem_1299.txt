b'\nChef has two babies Chefu and Chefi. He teaches the children to walk. Out of the curiosity, Chef wants to know if Chefu and Chefi have similar walking patterns. As chefu and chefi are babies, they can move only one unit at a time. In other words, if we can think walking arena as a 2D graph, babies can move one unit in x direction or y-direction or both.if (x,y) is the initial co-ordinate, moving (x,y)(x,y) to (x+1,y),(x,y+1),(x+1,y+1),(x\xe2\x88\x921,y),(x,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x\xe2\x88\x921,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x+1,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x\xe2\x88\x921,y+1)(x+1,y),(x,y+1),(x+1,y+1),(x\xe2\x88\x921,y),(x,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x\xe2\x88\x921,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x+1,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x\xe2\x88\x921,y+1) are example of valid moves.\nThe walking pattern is said to be similar if the their score in every t sec is same. \nFor example- \nChefu Pattern: He walks from point A to B in first t sec and then to C in next t sec and optimal score between A and B is x and between B and C is y.\nChefi Pattern: She walks from point P to Q in first t sec and then R in next t sec and optimal score between P and Q is z and between Q and R is w.\nThe walking pattern is similar if value of (x,y)(x,y) is same as (z,w)(z,w) irrespective of order. For ex.- In this case it can be similar if (x=3,y=4,z=4,w=3)(x=3,y=4,z=4,w=3) or (x=3,y=4,z=3,w=4)(x=3,y=4,z=3,w=4).\nOptimal Score is the total number of  valid moves baby takes from reaching A to B.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nThe first line of each test case contains one integers MM denoting the number of points.\nEach of the next 2\xe2\x88\x97m2\xe2\x88\x97m lines contains two integers x,yx,y denoting the co-ordinates. First m lines contains co-ordinates of Chefu\'s and next m lines contains co-ordinates of Chefi\'s path.   \n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output "YES" or "NO" to tell if the pattern is similar or not.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n1\n3\n0 0\n1 1\n1 3\n0 0\n2 1\n3 1\n\nSample Output:\nYES\n\nEXPLANATION:\nChefu\'s path is [(0,0),(1,1),(1,3)].\nOptimal scores between points in chefu\'s path is 1 and 2.\nChefi\'s path is [(0,0),(2,1),(3,1)].\nOptimal scores between points in chefi\'s path is 2 and 1.\nTherefore, there path is similar.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85shivank01\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SIMBABY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, math, shivank01\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-12-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

b'\nThere is a planet named \xe2\x80\x9cRuizland\xe2\x80\x9d having NN cities, These cities are connected in the form of a tree by a bidirectional path of specified length(in miles). Cities are numbered from 11 to NN. City number 11 is the capital city.\nMM pilgrims started their journey from the capital city having initial energy E1,E2,\xe2\x80\xa6,EME1,E2,\xe2\x80\xa6,EM respectively which reduces on moving from one city to another by a certain amount(A)(A).\nAA is calculated as follows:-\n\nConsider two cities UU and VV having an edge length of KK miles.\nThe total number of distinct cities from the capital city to the city UU is DD (city UU and capital city both are inclusive).\nIf a pilgrim moves from city UU to VV, then A=K\xe2\x88\x97DA=K\xe2\x88\x97D.\n\nOut of NN cities, There are some special cities (except the capital city) that are connected to only one city. All pilgrims want to reach any of the special cities. A pilgrim will stop his journey as soon as the energy of the pilgrims becomes 00 or reaches any of the special cities.\nInitially, all cities have 00 pilgrims except the capital city.\nFind the maximum count of special cities that is non-empty (at least one pilgrim is present) after the end of the journey of all the pilgrims given that pilgrims are allowed to take any path during their journey.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NN and MM separated by space, where NN is the number of cities and MM is the number of pilgrims.\nThe second line contains MM integers separated by spaces, denoting the initial energy of the pilgrims.\nNext, N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines consists of three integers UU, VV and KK separated by space where city UU and VV are connected by a bidirectional path whose length is KK miles\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, Print the maximum count of special cities that is non-empty (at least one pilgrim is present) after the end of the journey of all the pilgrims.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ei\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4Ei\xe2\x89\xa41018\n1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4106\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of MM over all test cases does not exceed 105105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6 4\n100 20 10 50\n1 2 10\n2 3 20\n2 4 30\n4 5 40\n1 6 50\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nThere are 33 special cities namely 3,53,5 and 66. The energy expected to reach these special cities are 50,19050,190 and 5050 respectively. Special city 55 cannot be reached by any pilgrim. If Pilgrim 11 goes to the special city 33 and pilgrim 44 goes to the special city 66, then the maximum number of non-empty special cities is 22.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85adikr_singh\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PILGRIMS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, DFS, BFS, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2170\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

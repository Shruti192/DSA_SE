b'\n\xc2\xa0\n\nToday Fluffy the squirrel received an array a(again). This time, he wants to split it into k parts. For each part, he calculates the sum of the elements in that part. Then, he takes the maximum among all these sums. His goal is to minimize this maximum value. For all possible k, can you determine the minimum possible maximum value Fluffy can get if he split the array into k parts optimally? \n\nNote that the memory limit for Codechef is 1536MB.\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements in the array a. The next line contains n space-seperated integers, denoting the elements of the array. \n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOutput n space-seperated integers, which denotes the minimum possible maximum value Fluffy can get if he split the array into k parts.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (19 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 20\nSubtask 2 (21 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 300\nSubtask 3 (33 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 3000\nSubtask 4 (27 points) : Original Constraints, Time Limit = 1s\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n6\n2 3 4 4 5 9\n\nOutput:\n27 14 9 9 9 9\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case. If k = 1, then the only way is to keep the whole array, which has maximum 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 27. If k = 2, then Fluffy can split the array into [2, 3, 4, 4] and [5, 9], which has maximum sum 5 + 9 = 14. If k = 3, then Fluffy can split the array into [2, 3, 4], [4, 5], [9], which has maximum sum 9. For the remaining values of k, it can be seen that no matter how we split, the maximum sum is still 9.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85zscoder\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MCO16502\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, easy, zscoder\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-11-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers N, A and B, denoting the number of important days and values describing when Limak looks good respectively.\n\n\nThe second line contains N distinct integers t1, t2, ..., tN, denoting important days.\nThese values are sorted increasingly.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible number of important days when Limak will look good.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 6\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 150,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 A \xe2\x89\xa4 B \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ti \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nti < ti+1\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (20 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, ti, A, B \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nSubtask #2 (20 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nSubtask #3 (20 points): A = 1\nSubtask #4 (40 points): Original constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n5 4 8\n2 3 6 8 9\n8 6 12\n8 9 12 13 15 17 18 25\n8 6 12\n8 9 12 13 15 17 18 24\n5 50000123 100000123\n700000123 710000123 770000123 780000123 790000123\n22 6 20\n3 9 12 22 24 25 34 46 47 51 53 62 64 66 68 73 79 92 93 95 96 98\n3 1 1000\n1 17 1000\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n6\n5\n5\n20\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1.\nThere are 5 important days.\nSince Limak had his hair cut on the day 0, he can just wait and he will look good on days 4 through 8 (during that time, the number of days from the most recent haircut will be between A and B).\nThere are 2 important days (6 and 8) in that interval.\nThere exists a strategy that allows Limak to look good on 3 important days.\nFor example, he could get a new haircut on the day 1 \xe2\x80\x94 then he will look good on days 5 through 9, including 3 important days.\nIt turns out that it's impossible that Limak would look good on 4 or more important days.\nSo the answer is 3.\n\nTest case 2.\nLimak should get a haircut on the day 6, to look good on days 12 through 18.\nThen he should get a haircut on the day 19, to look good on days 25 through 31.\nIn total, he will look good on 6 important days: 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 25.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85errichto\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HAIRCUT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2656\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-03-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

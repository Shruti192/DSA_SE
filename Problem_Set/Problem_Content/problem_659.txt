b'\nMr. Shaurya is a great competitive programmer of NIT Kurukshetra. He tries his best to teach Algorithms and Data Structures to his juniors in the best possible way. He always gives creative questions to his students so that students never get bored. As this year is bad because of COVID-19, he tries to give a problem on Coronavirus to his students. He came up with an interesting question.\nThere is a matrix AA of size N\xe2\x88\x97MN\xe2\x88\x97M, consisting of NN rows and MM columns.  The rows are numbered from 1,2,..,N1,2,..,N and columns are numbered from 1,2,...,M1,2,...,M. Each cell is represented by AAi,ji,j. The cell can be empty, blocked, or contain the deadly coronavirus. The virus can move only in the same row or in the same column until it gets blocked. The virus can only move in empty positions and contaminate the cell. You have to count the number of cells that get contaminated. Each cell can contain at most 11 virus, and cells can be contaminated by more than 1 virus. The cells containing the virus initially are also contaminated.\nInput:\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases.\nThe Second line contains two space-separated integers NN and MM, denoting the number of rows and columns of the matrix.\nThe next NN lines contain MM space-separated integers. The integer 0 denotes empty cell, 1 denotes cell containing a virus, and -1 denotes that the cell is blocked.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single integer on a new line denoting the number of cells contaminated by the Corona Virus.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSum of N\xe2\x88\x97MN\xe2\x88\x97M for all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4106\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample Input:\n2\n3 3\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n4 5\n1 0 0 -1 0\n-1 -1 0 0 1\n0 1 -1 0 -1\n0 0 0 0 0\n\nSample Output:\n5\n10\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFirst test Case : A1,1 can move only in row 1 and column 1 i.e, at position A1,2, A1,3, A2,1, A3,1. Thus, total contaminated cells are 5 including A1,1.\nSecond Test Case : A1,1 can move at cells only A1,1, A1,2, A1,3. It cannot move to cell A1,4 and to its right because cell A1,4 is blocked. Similarly A1,1 can not move downwards. \nA3,2 can move to A3,1 and A4,2.  A2,5 can move to A2,3, A2,4 and A1,5. Thus total contaminated cells are 10.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85vasu2907\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ENC2020B\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 binary-search, dynamic-programming, enco2020, vasu2907\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

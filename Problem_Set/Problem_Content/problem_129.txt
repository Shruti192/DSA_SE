b'\nGotham city is in danger. All the people from Gotham were airlifted and they are going to be dropped at different districts of a new safe city.\nThere are NN districts located at position (1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N)(1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N) in a straight line in this newly built safe city.\nAn array(P) is given which tells us about the maximum capacity of people that can be accommodated in the districts.\nThere is a condition that people can move only in the forward direction(i.e from city ii to i+1i+1 for 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N) to get shelter.\nPeople want to travel as little as possible to get shelter.\nThe sad part is that in case any person who does not get shelter is going to die.\nInitially, all the districts in the new city are empty.\nYou are asked QQ queries.\n\nEach query consists of two Integers XX and KK, where KK denotes the number of people who are going to be dropped at district XX.\nYou are required to print the total sum of distance traveled by the people in the current query(that got shelter or did not die) in a new line.\n\nNote:- Queries are not independent(they depend on the previous queries).\nInput\n\nFirst Line consists of one Integer NN, where NN is the number of districts.\nSecond line consists of NN integers of (array P) separated by a space.\nThird Line contains an integer QQ, which denotes the number of queries.\nNext, QQ lines consist of two integers XX and KK separated by space.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, you have to print the total sum of distance traveled by the people in the current query(that got shelter or did not die ) in a new line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P[i]\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4P[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nExample Input\n4\n5 5 6 1\n2\n2 11\n2 3\n\nExample Output\n6\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nQuery 11: 55 people will get shelter in city 22 and the remaining 66 will get shelter in city 33. So, the total distance covered in this query is 66.\nQuery 22: Only 11 person can get shelter in city 44 and the rest will die. So, the total distance traveled is 22.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85adikr_singh\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GOTHAM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2090\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

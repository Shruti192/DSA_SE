b"\nRead problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.\nChef has been working in a restaurant which has NN floors. He wants to minimise the time it takes him to go from the NN-th floor to ground floor. He can either take the elevator or the stairs.\nThe stairs are at an angle of 4545 degrees and Chef's velocity is V1V1 m/s when taking the stairs down. The elevator on the other hand moves with a velocity V2V2 m/s. Whenever an elevator is called, it always starts from ground floor and goes to NN-th floor where it collects Chef (collecting takes no time), and makes its way down to the ground floor with Chef in it.\nThe elevator covers a total distance equal to NN meters when going from NN-th floor to ground floor or vice versa, while the length of the stairs is N\xe2\x88\x972\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x88\x9aN\xe2\x88\x972 because the stairs is at angle 4545 degrees.\nChef has enlisted your help to decide whether he should use stairs or the elevator to minimise his travel time. Can you help him out?\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TT, the number of test cases. \nEach test case is described by a single line containing three space-separated integers NN, V1V1, V2V2.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line with string Elevator or Stairs, denoting the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,V1,V2\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N,V1,V2\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 10 15\n2 10 14\n7 14 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nElevator\nStairs\nStairs\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nmelnik\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ELEVSTRS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Conditional Statements, Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1066\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-08-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

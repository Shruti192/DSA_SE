b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. He takes a sheet of paper and for each non-empty subsequence BB of this sequence, he does the following:\n\nFor each integer which appears in BB, count its number of occurrences in the sequence BB.\nChoose the integer with the largest number of occurrences. If there are several options, choose the smallest one.\nFinally, write down the chosen integer (an element of BB) on the sheet of paper.\n\nFor each integer between 11 and NN inclusive, find out how many times it appears on Chef's sheet of paper. Since these numbers may be very large, compute them modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+7109+7).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NN space-separated integers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these integers should be the number of occurrences of ii on Chef's sheet of paper.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 500,000500,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000\nSubtask #2 (10 points): A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN is a permutation of the integers 11 through NN\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n2 2 3\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0 6 1\n2 1\n3 4 0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 3: There are 77 non-empty subsequences:\n\n[1][1] (Chef writes down 11)\n[2][2] (Chef writes down 22)\n[2][2] (Chef writes down 22)\n[1,2][1,2] (Chef writes down 11)\n[1,2][1,2] (Chef writes down 11)\n[2,2][2,2] (Chef writes down 22)\n[1,2,2][1,2,2] (Chef writes down 22)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85bthero\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SUBSFREQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Combinatorics, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Sorting, Observation, Subsequence\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Mathematics, Algorithms, Groupings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2357\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"

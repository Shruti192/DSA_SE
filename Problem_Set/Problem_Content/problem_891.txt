b'\nToday, You and ChefChef went for a drive on a straight road with no cars on the highway early in the morning. But to Chef\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment the highway is not so smooth, it has some potholes and moreover the highway has a fixed length, after that it is brokenbroken. The highway is straight and is given in the form of a binary string. Binary string is a string consisting of only 1s and 0s. 1s representing the highway is smoothsmooth at that point and 0s representing the highway has potholespotholes in that position.\nChef\xe2\x80\x99s car has initial fuel in the car as FF, which represents the distance the car can travel with that much fuel. Chef\xe2\x80\x99s car has a reserve fuel in it too but at any point it can be used for increasing the fuel from FF to F+1F+1. Assume he has unlimited reserve fuel but can only use 11 unit of it to increase FF to F+1F+1 at a stopping point and as soon as FF becomes 00 he will not be able to use his reserve fuel anymore.\nChef can use F\xe2\x88\x921F\xe2\x88\x921 fuel or FF fuel and due to the reserve he can also use F+1F+1 fuel. So he has 33 points to stop at F\xe2\x88\x921+P,F+P,F+1+PF\xe2\x88\x921+P,F+P,F+1+P where P is the current position and at those points the fuel for the next part of the journey will be F\xe2\x88\x921,F,F+1F\xe2\x88\x921,F,F+1 respectively. Chef stops when he has 00 Fuel left with him and in this case he can\xe2\x80\x99t use his reserve fuel. But he can\xe2\x80\x99t stop at a position with a pothole.\nSo, he asks you to tell him that, will he be able to stop on a flat surface and not a pothole until his fuel FF becomes 00, within the bounds of the highway. If there is still fuel left till the end of the highway then he will not stop within the bounds of the highway and the answer would be NONO otherwise the answer is YESYES if he stops within the highway and always stops at flat surfaces.\n\nInput:\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains two lines.\nFirst line contains an integer nn, the length of the highway and FF, initial fuel.\nSecond line contains a string SS consisting of 0s0s and 1s1s.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the answer : YES or NO.\n\nConstraints\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103+41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103+4\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4101001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4F\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4F\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1(15 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410, 1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450, 1\xe2\x89\xa4F\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4F\xe2\x89\xa4n\nSubtask #2(25 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100, 1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4103, 1\xe2\x89\xa4F\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4F\xe2\x89\xa4n\nSubtask #3(60 points): Original Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n3\n6 2\n101100\n6 1\n101000\n7 3\n1100101\n\nSample Output:\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor the first case, he starts at position 1 and from position 1 he has 3 options to chose i.e. to index 2, 3 or 4. He will not chose 2 because there is a pothole where he has to stop at 2. He will chose index 3 and will stop there. Now at index 3 he has a fuel of 2 so he again have options of going at 4,5,6 and he will go to index 4 and stop there. At index 4 now he has a fuel of 1 unit. So he can now use no fuel option(because he can chose 1-1=0 fuel) and hence has stopped.\nFor the second case, he starts at position 1 with a fuel of 1 and he can stop there itself choosing the no fuel option(F-1) and can stop there only.\nFor the last case, there will be no way in which Chef could stop himself within the bound of the highway, there will be still fuel left.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\npec_chapter\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHDF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dynamic-programming, greedy, pec_chapter, recursion, ucsp2021\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-03-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'

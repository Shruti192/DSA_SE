Since he does not want to be late, he is asking you for help.\nThere are NN bags with coins in a row (numbered 11 through NN); for each valid ii, the ii-th bag contains AiAi coins. Chef should make the number of coins in each bag divisible by a given integer KK in the following way:\n\nchoose an integer cc between 00 and NN (inclusive)\ntake some coins from the first cc bags \xe2\x80\x95 formally, for each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4c1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4c), he may choose any number of coins between 00 and AiAi inclusive and take them out of the ii-th bag\nmove some of these coins to some of the last N\xe2\x88\x92cN\xe2\x88\x92c bags \xe2\x80\x95 formally, for each ii (c+1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Nc+1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), he may place a non-negative number of coins in the ii-th bag\n\nOf course, the number of coins placed in the last N\xe2\x88\x92cN\xe2\x88\x92c bags must not exceed the number of coins taken out from the first cc bags, but there may be some coins left over. Let's denote the number of these coins by RR. You should find the smallest possible value of RR.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NN and KK.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest value of RR.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): K=2K=2\nSubtask #2 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa43N\xe2\x89\xa43\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 7\n1 14 4 41 1\n3 9\n1 10 19\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One of the possible solutions is to choose c=4c=4, remove 11, 00, 44 and 1313 coins from bags 11, 22, 33 and 44 respectively, and add 1313 coins to bag 55.\nExample case 2: The optimal solution is to choose c=3c=3 and remove one coin from each bag.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85sahi1422\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CASH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Mathematics, Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
